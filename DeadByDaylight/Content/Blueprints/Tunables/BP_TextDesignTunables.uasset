Limited Use License</b></font> <br /> <br /> BHVR hereby grants to you a limited, personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable, non-assignable and fully revocable license to use the Game and any Content therefrom for your individual, non-commercial, entertainment purposes only. The foregoing license is subject to the following: (1) you are current with your payment of all applicable fees for the use of the Game and BHVR Services to which you have subscribed and (2) you comply with the Terms of Use (if any), this EULA and the Privacy Policy and you are not otherwise in breach of any BHVR Terms.

Dispute Resolution</b></font> <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>A. Equitable Remedies</i></font> <br /> <br /> You hereby acknowledge and agree that BHVR would suffer irreparable harm if this EULA or any of the BHVR Terms were not specifically enforced. Consequently, in addition to such monetary and other relief as may be recoverable at law, you agree that BHVR shall be entitled to specific performance or other injunctive relief, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, as remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this EULA or any other BHVR Terms. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>B. Informal Negotiations</i></font> <br /> <br /> To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this EULA or any other BHVR Terms (“Dispute”), you and BHVR agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other. BHVR will send its notice to your billing address (if provided) and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us. You agree to send your notice to Behaviour Digital Inc. via email to <a href="event:mailto:support@bhvr.com"><b>support@bhvr.com</b></a>. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>C. Formal Dispute Resolution</i></font> <br /> <br /> If you and BHVR are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or BHVR may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by the courts of the Province of Quebec. <br /> <br /> <font size="20"><b>III. General Terms</b></font> <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>A. Remedies</i></font> <br /> <br /> You agree that this EULA is not intended to confer and do not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this EULA. You also understand and agree that the Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, this EULA and any other BHVR Terms, including BHVR‘s enforcement thereof, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or remedies upon any person. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>B. Severability</i></font> <br /> <br /> If any part of this EULA or the BHVR Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of BHVR, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>C. Assignment</i></font> <br /> <br /> BHVR may assign this EULA, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign this EULA without BHVR’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>D. Waiver</i></font> <br /> <br /> The failure of BHVR (or its licensors) to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this EULA or any BHVR Terms shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by BHVR (or its licensors) of any provision, condition or requirement of this EULA or any BHVR Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>E. Force Majeure</i></font> <br /> <br /> BHVR shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of BHVR, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond BHVR’s control such as acts of god, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>F. Governing Law</i></font> <br /> <br /> The laws of Quebec, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this EULA and any other BHVR Terms; and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with BHVR or relating in any way to this EULA, any other BHVR Terms, or your use of any BHVR Services resides in the Courts of the Province of Quebec, and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of the Province of Quebec in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving BHVR or its affiliates, employees, contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers. As noted in this EULA, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, national, and international laws. <br /> <br /> The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. <br /> <br /> Those who choose to access the Game or any other BHVR Service from locations outside of Canada do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that other laws apply, this EULA shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction and be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions hereof. <br /> <br /> <font color="#78acbb"><i>G. Entire Agreement</i></font> <br /> <br /> This EULA, the Privacy Policy, and any other BHVR Terms, including any posted rules or instructions regarding a particular activity, poll, or contest constitute the entire agreement between you and BHVR relating to your rights and obligations in the use of the Game and the BHVR Services.
