    Description: Death won't accept him and thus he remains, a calamity, indisputable master of his victims' nightmares. <b>The Nightmare</b> passively puts Survivors to sleep over <b>60 seconds</b>, after which they enter the <b>Dream World.</b> Awake Survivors hear the Terror Radius and see <b>The Nightmare</b> from within <b>16 meters.</b> <b>The Nightmare</b> appears intermittently to awake Survivors from <b>16 meters</b> to <b>32 meters</b>, and is invisible to awake Survivors beyond that.<br><br>Hold the <i>Power button</i> to place a <b>Dream Snare</b> on the ground directly in front of <b>The Nightmare</b> which will afflict Survivors with the <b>Hindered status effect</b>, slowing them while they remain in the trap and for short duration after leaving it.<br><br>Hold the <i>Active Ability button</i> to perform a <b>Dream Projection</b> and teleport to a generator in your view. Releasing the button early will cancel the action. For each Survivor in the <b>Dream World</b>, the cooldown of <b>Dream Projection</b> is reduced by <b>15%</b>.<br><br> Once in the <b>Dream World</b>, Survivors hear a Lullaby instead of the Terror Radius and can be affected by <b>Dream Snares</b> placed by <b>The Nightmare</b>. Survivors can wake up by failing skill checks, finding an awake Survivor to perform the <b>Wake Up</b> action, or by using the <b>alarm clocks</b> found within the environment. Each successive <b>Wake Up</b> action takes twice as long to perform. Using the alarm clock will give Survivors <b>30 seconds</b> before they start falling asleep again.
