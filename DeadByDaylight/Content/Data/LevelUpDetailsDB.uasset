Title: THE BLOODWEB
Description: <P ALIGN="CENTER">Your mind has opened up to the Bloodweb.<br><br><FONT SIZE="22" COLOR="#ffe7c5"><i>”Last night I got out of The Fog, in a manner of speaking. I arrived in a pocket of tranquility where the monster was nowhere to be seen. I stopped running and was immediately filled with a strange calmness. I lay down near the bonfire and closed my eyes for the first time in what seemed like days. After long, deep breaths, I plunged into what I first thought was the darkness of a dreamless sleep. And then, I saw it. The Bloodweb, a space between reality and abstraction. There is no sleep here, only torment. Even my own mind is shared and bent at The Entity's will.” -Benedict Baker's Journal, Nov. 1896</i></FONT>

The deeper I go, the more marvel I can extirpate from the figment of The Fog. This comes at a price, however. The Entity that rules over this world grows restless with my attempts to know more. Each time I move further on the web, It makes sure to devour and consume something else. I must choose carefully what I want to extract from this journey across the web.” -Benedict Baker's Journal, Dec. 1896</i></FONT>
