Name: Ironworks of Misery
ThemeName: The Macmillan Estate
Description: The beating heart of the Mine, the Foundry was where the iron ore was directly smelted into vast ingots. The huge vats still bear evidence of the bodies that were incinerated within them - preserved in the metal residue.

Wads of cash were hidden all over the place. Stating that money wasn’t an issue, maybe people got executed for enjoyment, rather than wealth.

Wiser travellers learned to decline that offer. The phones never worked and people had a peculiar habit of going missing. When the highway came through, bypassing Gas Heaven entirely, business dried up and the gas station was abandoned. No one quite knows how many bodies are stashed out there, or what else is hidden in the ruins of the old rest stop.

It was originally intended to house sick animals at a safe distance from the rest of the livestock, but no animal who entered it ever survived. An investigation revealed the building was infested with toxic mold. The Thompsons figured it must be a construction fault or something to do with the dampness of the wood. A new barn was built, and the old cowshed was left to rot in the shadows.

There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor.

More than a century old, the dwelling is in surprisingly good condition, though it shows signs of often being patched and mended. The forest holds the house tightly in its grasp, growing over and around it like a second skin. Only once inside is it clear that someone still lives there. It is warm and welcoming and lovingly decorated, with a large living space, a bedroom and a corner dedicated for little ones. Here they are protected from the harsh winter of the northern forest.

Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.
