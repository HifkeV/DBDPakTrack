    ARCHIVE_Tome02_TITLE
    He moves through the death and decay of the void. He doesn't remember his name. Everything's a blur. He feels pain in his stomach. In his arms. In his veins. He needs… he needs to find one of those… flowers… the nectar… the sweet serum that gives… strength.  Strength for what? He remembers… the killers… experimenting on them. Why? Why was he experimenting on them? He doesn't… remember. He caused a lot of suffering, but he doesn't feel remorse. He doesn't even know if he should feel remorse. He doesn't feel anything but an ache in the pit of his stomach for power.
    Memory 1746
    He has flashes of The Doctor. His screams. His agony. Turning the tables on him.  Experimenting on him like he had done with so many others. Where? Not here. Somewhere else. Another world. All of these… these… survivors… marooned from other… worlds... How does he know this? He doesn't remember… He remembers the experiments. What was he trying to understand? The nectar? The serum? The right dose? The right dose… to use without hurting himself. Too late.
    Memory 1747
    He feels the hunger. Not for food or drink. Not for talk or fun. For a flower. A single flower. For serum. He knows The Entity is watching him. He knows it. Feels it inside his bones. He doesn't want to be snatched for another trial. To suffer or cause suffering. And to what end? The great horrible mystery of it all. He wants to understand this place. He does. But he senses that to know… to really know would drive him… mad. Madness. That's what this place is. The embodiment of madness. He doesn't want to be pulled into another trial. He wants to return home. He must return home. That's why he was studying the serum. It gave him insight. Insight to what? He doesn't remember.
    Memory 1748
    Home… he doesn't even remember where home is. He only remembers The Void. Hundreds maybe thousands of discarded survivors. Not dead. Not alive. Something else. Alive but dead inside. Burnt. Emotionless. Useless to The Entity. He remembers… he remembers rising from The Void, finding… a flower... Had this flower been his salvation? Had the flower been his way out? He falls to his knees and shouts at the abyss and the abyss answers with… silence. The silence is so deafening it hurts. He buckles over. Climbs to his knees. He needs… serum…
    Memory 1749
    He's lost. He doesn't know where he is. He sees things like tentacles reaching out for him from the fog and he knows they're not real. None of it is. He's losing his mind if he hasn't lost it already. His eyes play tricks on him. He sees giant, nameless creatures looming over him. Doesn't matter. They're not real. None of it is. His hunger confuses him. Oppresses him. He'd do anything for that feeling again. Anything. Even… return to the trials. He would. He'd rip survivors and killers apart limb from limb for that feeling again. He begins to mumble words. A promise… one flower… one flower… and I will do anything…
    Memory 1750
    Claudette is seven years old and feels alone. Very alone. Yes, her parents love her. Yes, they want the world for her. But the world doesn't want her. Or, at least, that's what Claudette believes. She just wants to fit in. Fit in at school. Fit in with her cousins. Fit in with her teammates on the soccer pitch. But fitting in isn't as simple as being like others. She's different and she knows it.<br><br>She feels slow. Unresponsive. Not quick enough to understand her teacher or keep up with her class.  The librarian calls her ‘addle minded.' When she talks, she stutters. Sometimes she loses her breath and has trouble recognizing when she's talking too loudly. But most of all her teacher embarrasses her. Says she's in the clouds. Always in the clouds. Get out of the clouds, Claudette! But she can't help it. She's exploring massive gardens and colorful bugs on strange new worlds.
    Memory 1087
    Claudette feels things more than others. Much more. Like the shame of not being invited to any birthday parties. Not one party. Every day her parents ask her who she played with at lunch and every day she lowers her chin and tells them she doesn't want to talk.<br><br>Her parents ask her teacher and her teacher tells them she likes to play alone. Not so much play. More like collect and observe things. Flowers. Weeds. Beetles. Worms. Rocks. Some kids are just loners. Every day her parents ask her about her friends and every day the shame returns. They want her to have friends. More than that they want a list of names for her birthday. But she doesn't have a list of names. She doesn't even have one name.
    Memory 1088
    Claudette observes a beetle while her classmates chase one another around the playground. She wants to play but no one wants to be around her. She doesn't want to think about it. Thinking about it hurts. Thinking about it reminds her she will disappoint her mother again.<br><br>Her mother just wants her to have a friend. But making a friend isn't easy. Not for Claudette. And she wishes more than anything that it was as easy for her as it was for others. She wishes she had a friend to make her parents worry less. Maybe they would even be proud. Maybe she should give up her passion for bugs and flowers. Maybe that would help. Maybe then she would be like other kids. But the need to explore and collect is strong. It is not beyond her. It is her.
    Memory 1089
    Claudette loves to collect things and she knows this is why many call her weird. Her father tells her she's perfect the way she is. He tells her a man named Darwin used to collect bugs and plants, too. He had a big imagination like her. He often mused on ideas and theories and boy did he come up with a whopper of a theory! He explains the theory, and she understands. Her father has a way of taking complicated ideas and making them easy to understand. Darwin. Claudette likes the name. She smiles. Stares at her favorite blue and green beetle and names him… Darwin… 
    Memory 1090
    Claudette's mom is crying. She's upset because Claudette is having trouble in school. Her grades are lower than they've ever been. She doesn't understand what she's doing wrong as a parent. Her dad says she's doing nothing wrong. He says Claudette's wired differently and that's okay. Her mom doesn't want her to collect plants and bugs anymore. Her dad says that's the best part of her and he doesn't need a child who fits some bell-curve. More than this he defends her. He tells her mother that the greatest treasures gifted to the world were from those who didn't conform. Who weren't normal. Who didn't fit some outdated bell-curve. Tolstoy. Tesla. Einstein. Shakespeare. Her mother doesn't care. A sudden cry escapes her lips. I don't want her to repeat the year.
    Memory 1091
    Claudette hides under the covers pretending to be asleep. Pretending she can't hear the yelling. Her mother wants her to get special help, but her father doesn't want to alienate her. He's right. Claudette doesn't want other kids to know she needs special help. They'll laugh at her. She'll figure things out. She promises she will. Her new substitute teacher Mrs. Cahil is helping her. A lot more than the other teacher who always said she was in the clouds. Her father says stress is the worst thing for a child's developing brain. Leave her be! Let her grow at her own pace! Stress shrinks the brain. Destroys confidence. Kills creativity. He doesn't want her studying at lunchtime. Lunchtime is for real growth. Authentic growth. Growth unhindered by the pressure of tests and the fear of making mistakes.
    Memory 1092
    Claudette's mother is happy because her grades are improving. A single teacher can make a difference. Can make all the difference. Especially this teacher. Mrs. Cahil. Other kids call her strange and weird. But Mrs. Cahil isn't weird. She just gets it. She understands because she had a tough time learning when she was a student. This is why she makes an extra effort to help Claudette. To help her understand what she is explaining in class without alienating her.
    Memory 1093
    Claudette is happy because her new teacher is helping her. Really helping her. She's learning new things every day. More than facts and vocabulary she's learning how to learn. Or rather, she's learning how she learns and that is the key. But her teacher is doing something else.  Her teacher is talking to her. She's talking to her about her ‘issue' and how her ‘issue' is really a blessing in disguise if she can just learn how to succeed in a system that favors one type of ‘smart' at the expense of all the others.  A system that frowns on taking chances or making mistakes when making mistakes and taking chances is what is needed for learning. For true learning. Her teacher tells her that she has passion and passion is everything.
    Memory 1094
    Claudette knows she's not like other kids and she doesn't have to be. Things like ‘bell curves' and ‘ideal student' don't apply to her and that's okay. The ideal mold is a prison for those wired differently and her teacher has set her free.  Her grades are getting better and a test is coming. She writes, visualizes, and imagines everything she needs to remember and somehow this works. The right teacher at the right time can make all the difference.<br><br>Her parents are proud. Very proud. But still her mother wishes she had friends. Still her mother wishes she liked what other girls liked. Her parents argue in another room about what to get for her birthday. Her mother wants to buy a new doll. Her father thinks she'd like something more related to bugs, plants and bacteria. The suggestion upsets her mother. He father defends her. See her for who she is and not who you want her to be!<br><br>Her mother goes silent. She suddenly releases a cry and says she doesn't want her to be bullied like she was bullied throughout school. Claudette's eyes go wide. For the first time in her life… she realizes… her mother's wired differently, too.
    Memory 1095
    Claudette will be eight-years-old tomorrow. She should be eager. She should be excited. She should be counting the hours, minutes, seconds... Instead, she is none of these. She dreads the moment she will have to open her gift. Every year it's the same. Dolls. Crafts. Jewelry. Nothing that means anything to her. Maybe this year she'll smile and pretend she didn't want a magnifying glass or a collection of stones or a set of books on botany. Maybe… to make things easier… she'll pretend. Maybe that will make her mother less scared for her. Seeing her happy about her grades felt good. Real good.
    Memory 1096
    I would start at the beginning, but I don't know when that was or how long ago I was banished to this prison. What I know is I've been observing and studying the inner workings of this Entity that had once been… well… an obsession.  How ironic that I should be sentenced to live out the rest of my days in the very thing I sought to destroy. An obsession turned prison… as all obsessions are, I suppose.

    The atmosphere of the realms is dark and grim to say the least but also… everchanging. I've already remarked that the atmosphere is misty even foggy at times and that this fog feels alive. It seems to contain swirls and streams of memories or imprints of beings from multiple terra worlds. It is as if The Entity absorbs all the psychic energy and thoughts of beings it snatches as it journeys through the endless cosmos.<br><br>I've used the Auris to study the black fog and have come to three observations that will prove invaluable to finding a way home. First, the fog is rich in Auric particles leading me to believe this dimension is more conscious than it is material. Second, I should be able to manifest anything I am able to pull from rifts in the fog using techniques passed down from my family. Third… The Entity is far more ancient than we ever suspected back home and most of our theories and conjectures were wrong. The rich presence of Auric particles and cells suggest it is one of the Original Ones—an Ancient.

    The Entity is the cosmic embodiment of evil. Back home we witnessed how its very presence turns worlds inside out… how it seems to remove or extinguish any sense of empathy or compassion within communities… how it brings people to the brink of madness and… well… pushes them in. Now I understand it does all this in order to rip victims from their lives and have them play out an endless trial of terror that it presumably needs for its own survival.  And there, perhaps, lies the key to its destruction… if an Ancient can be destroyed at all.<br><br>End the trials. Destroy its ability to sap dark nectar from victims like a cruel parasite feeding from a flower. At least the Archives affords me a better understanding of the Entity… why it moves from universe to universe, picking victims off and devouring worlds as though at a cosmic buffet. What I have yet to conclude is whether it is attracted to worlds that are brimming with darkness and madness or if it is in fact the catalyst of such darkness and madness.
    Arcus 142
    All planes of existence are a unique mix of conscious Auric particles and material particles. The Entity is almost certainly pure consciousness… The observable fact of existence is the material world responds to and changes with consciousness… collective consciousness is the key… The body, the home, the trial—all of it is an expression of The Entity's unconscious need for fear and terror.<br><br>The distinct observation in the specimens chosen by The Entity is that they all come from worlds that have failed to understand the metaphysical relationship between their thoughts and the world they live in. This is not by chance. It is, to my mind, self-preservation. Victims who know this truth and have honed their ability to manifest could be poisonous to The Entity.  This leads me to believe The Entity is attracted to dark worlds because darkness and chaos are clear indicators that inhabitants have failed to connect the dots between the collective consciousness and the health of their world. The conclusion, then, might be that The Entity feeds off ignorance.

    Hard to tell when one day ends and another begins. The tower and the library help me cope, but it's hard to forget the truth of my situation even for a moment knowing everything I have is a lie. I have access to anything I want and yet I have nothing.  The survivors continue to undergo the trials with the most brutal of killers.  I continue to search the fog for the memories of those who found a way to escape.  It sometimes feels like a futile search. But then again… I've got time on my hands… lots of time…

    Evan is fourteen years old and he knows something his father doesn't. The thought thrills him. Amazes him. Scares him. There is something his father doesn't know. Something the owner of one of the most profitable mines in all of Seattle doesn't know.<br><br>His father manages his workers with an iron fist. No. Not an iron fist. Brass knuckles.  He calls them maggots. Groveling maggots. He's about to discover he's wrong. They're more than maggots. Much more. They're men. And men working together can bring change. One of these men is inspiring others to take their lives back. If they can stand together, maybe just maybe they can bring in the union. With the union they'll have rights. More than rights. They'll have dignity. Freedom. Time. Time to spend with their friends. Time to spend with their family. Time to be human. Evan knows something his father doesn't know… and he feels empowered.
    Memory 1235
    Evan's father thrusts him to the ground. Calls him weak. Tells him he's got to stop being so nice to the maggots. Stop talking to them. Stop helping them. Keep them in line. Break them. Let them know who's boss. If you give them an inch, they'll take a yard. They're just using you! Evan knows better than to say anything. His father punched and broke his jaw last year when he showed weakness. This year he'd rather not sip dinner through a straw. This year he holds back. Bites his tongue. He wants to tell his father about the union. But doesn't. He feels ashamed. Torn between his loyalty for his father and his friends. Bob. Tom. Jim. They deserve more.
    Memory 1236
    Evan enjoys creating something from nothing. He's not an artist but he enjoys sketching and he hides his sketches from his father. His father forbids sketching. Sketching is for weaklings. Vagabonds. Gypsies. He wants Evan to do worthy things. He drags Evan to his most profitable mine. He teaches him how to manage maggots. He's hands on. Very hands on. Abusive. Violent. Brutal. The key is… to break them. Break their will. Break their spirit. Once broken a human is a tool that can be wielded to do anything. Broken. It's what he did to his mother. It's what he's doing to him. But… Evan still sketches. Sketching is defiance.
    Memory 1237
    Evan watches his father yell at one of his workers. He's sick. He wants to leave. But he's not allowed. He leaves… he loses his job. Evan feels for the man. Wishes he could do something for him. He wants to tell him things are going to change. The union is coming. The union is coming and with it a good wage and fair working hours. But the man's lungs are black and his stomach is rot. Too much stress. Too much acid. Not enough sleep. He collapses. His father doesn't care. Kicks him in the gut. Tells Evan to drag him out of the mine. Evan drags him out. For a moment he feels disgusted at the man's weakness and wants to put... this… maggot out of its misery. He's becoming his father and he's not sure if that's a bad thing.
    Memory 1238
    Evan's father forces him to set a bear trap in a dark forest. His father's obsessed with hunting bears. Always has been. Always will be. He tells him the story. Always the same story. He doesn't want to hear it but he will. His father was hunting with his brother when they ran into a grizzly bear. The bear tore his uncle's arm off and bit into his head. Evan's father jumped on the grizzly's back. Stabbed the bear endlessly. Killed the bear. Ripped open its stomach to retrieve his brother's head. Carried his brother's mutilated body ten miles to their family estate. This time it's ten miles. Last time it was five. His father grins. The story is changing with every telling. Sometimes Evan wonders if there even was a bear.
    Memory 1239
    Evan's inspired in a way he's never been before. Furiously he sketches his father in a bear suit killing his uncle. He never met his uncle, but he's seen pictures. His uncle was a philanthropist. A bleeding heart. Disloyal. He would have run the business into the ground with proper wages and all that socialist crap. That's why he had to go. Evan doesn't have proof, but he knows. Deep down he knows his father murdered his uncle. Tied him up. Left him for a bear. There was no knife. No fight. No honor. Just a terrible death for a disloyal worm. Evan suspects all this and yet… he doesn't feel disgusted or ashamed. He feels something else. Something he's trying not to feel. Something… he won't admit to himself.
    Memory 1240
    Evan looms over his father's bed and watches him sleep. He hates and loves him at the same time. Sometimes he wonders what his life would be like without him. He owes him so much and yet he's miserable and alone. He raises a massive grey stone and holds it there for a long minute that feels like forever. He could be free. Truly free. But he can't. Not like this. He could free himself in other ways. Accidents happen. Hunting accidents. Mining accidents. He could lure him into the bowels of the mine and ignite a stick of dynamite. No way he'd survive. But despite it all, Evan can't do it. His love is bigger than his hate. He owes him too much.
    Memory 1241
    Evan sketches his father in a bear suit drowning his mother. He never believed his father's story. Something didn't feel right. His eyes. His grin. His lack of empathy. She was pulled into a current and never seen again. His mother… she was beautiful. Blonde hair. Blue eyes. Fun. Full of compassion. His opposite. She didn't just go out to swim one morning and never come back. She was getting in his way and no one gets in his way. Not even family. Especially not family.   

Obedience or death. Evan's tired of obedience. Yes, he's loyal to his father but he's also loyal to his friends. They talk to him. Encourage him. Think he's a great artist. He has friends. He's never really had a friend. His father wouldn't allow it. Waste of time. They're using you. Yes, he's loyal to his father but he's also loyal to his friends. They deserve better.
    Memory 1242
    Evan's father stares at him across the dinner table. He knows. Maybe he doesn't know but he senses something's amiss. He has that look in his eye. That look that tells Evan he's in for it. He chews on a fatty piece of rabbit and hopes his father doesn't say anything. He should have known better than to keep something from him. His father knows. He always knows. Last year Evan lost his cool on a man who said something about his mother. He almost beat the man to death with a two-by-four while his father watched and laughed. The authorities pulled Evan away. He smiled at Evan and knew what he wouldn't admit to himself. He enjoyed beating on that man. Not because of the insult. Not because he felt threatened. But because he felt… Powerful... His father smiled. Apple doesn't fall to far from the tree, eh?
    Memory 1243
    Evan find his sketches torn to bits. He puts the pieces together. All of them accounted for except one. He doesn't have the picture of his drowning mother. His father enters his room. Despair and dread overwhelm him. He waits for a blow that never comes. Instead his father tells him he has instinct and instinct is everything. He tells him he inherited his instinct from his side of the family. The same instinct that told him Evan was keeping something from him.<br><br>Don't pretend. I know. A few of your maggot friends sold you out for a few dollars. Evan starts but doesn't say anything. Can't say anything. The words are caught in his throat. He apologizes. His father says nothing. Walks away. Evan follows him to his bedroom where he sees… the picture of his dying mother… framed above the bed. His father tells Evan he will learn a lesson tomorrow. One he hopes he understands. Evan stares at his father and feels… hate… hate for the maggots who betrayed him and for his father… respect…. no… not respect… admiration…
    Memory 1244
    I have used the Auris to explore the memories of an unknown survivor who comes from a world where, from what I can gather, a cult for The Entity exists. It's not a surprise, or the first time I've seen such a thing, but the memories suggest she was a detective of sorts trying to prevent a cult sacrifice before she was snatched for the trials. I'm not sure what happened to her and will have to explore the fog to unravel more.

    I have culled imprints of a killer I have yet to observe. My best guess, judging by the nature of the crimes, is this brute is from Terra Dark. She lured men with love, robbed them of their savings and fed them to her pigs. Lovely. Efficient. And resourceful. The impressions of the memory are as follows…<br><br>…He stands framed in the doorway with flowers. A stupid smile on his dumb face. He has no sense that his days are numbered. Lonely soul made the trip for a wife. He thinks he'll get everything for a ring. Her land. Her farm. Her savings. Won't happen. Won't go as planned. Not as he planned, anyway. It didn't for all the other lonely souls who answered her classified ad. She peers at his eyes and thrills at his ignorance. His long, dumb face. His false sense of superiority. He wrote her a poem. How sweet. She'll cram it down his throat when he's convulsing on the floor. She takes his poem and asks about his money. He has it with him. Packed his savings in a bag and made the journey for a new start. He'll get more than he bargained for. Way more. To the bank with his money. To the pigs with him.

    Life is not life in this prison, and death is not an escape. It is merely the start of a new trial and most survivors are aware they are caught in something they will never understand. Why this is all happening is no longer obvious to me. The truth is… I don't know what to believe anymore… The Entity is… not what it is… or what I thought it was…

    Ace Visconti is one charming guy. With his sharp Italian looks, grey-streaked hair and silver tongue, he could pass for an aging 50s movie star. <br><br>His heart has always belonged to the cards. From his roots as a poor boy in Argentina, he gamed, scammed, seduced and smooth-talked his way to a life of luxury as a high roller in the land of opportunity. Despite money always having a way of slipping through his fingers, Ace always figured he could win more. <br><br>He never fulfilled that ambition; eventually he racked up too many debts with the wrong kind of people. And when they finally came to collect, Ace was nowhere to be found. No one knew who tipped him off or where he fled to, but anyone who knew Ace Visconti can agree on one thing. He will survive: against all odds.
    As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother started teaching her how to survive a harsh, solitary life in the northern woods. Living in such an extremely remote and dangerous area required skill and resilience. When sunlight became too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth’s warmth, Anna would rest in her mother’s arms, surrounded by the few wooden toys and masks she had crafted for her. Drifting off to sleep with stories and lullabies, she dreamt happy dreams, ignorant of the events that would soon change everything.<br><br>Anna and her mother were stalking a great elk through the woods. They knew it was dangerous prey, but it had been a particularly difficult winter and they were almost out of food. The specter of starvation frightened them more than any forest creature. Without warning, the elk reared, bellowed and charged at Anna. She was paralyzed with fear as the whole world seemed to shake under the immense beast's pounding hooves. The elk was close enough for Anna to see the murderous fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in its path, axe in hand. A bloodcurdling scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its antlers and hoisted her into the air. With all her strength, she brought her axe down on its head again and again while it tried to shake her loose. With a sickening crack, the antlers snapped and Anna's mother was free. The beast collapsed.<br><br>Anna was too small to move her mother's broken body, so she sat with her in the clearing where she had fallen. To distract her from the dying elk's cries, Anna's mother held her and hummed her favorite lullaby. They stayed like that, the huntress and the elk getting quieter and colder, until Anna was alone in the silent forest. Eventually she stood up and started the long walk back home.<br><br>Still a child, she knew just enough about life in the frozen forest to survive. She followed her instincts and became one with the wild. She got older and stronger and practiced her hunt. As she grew into a dangerous predator, her humanity became a half-remembered dream.<br><br>She widened her territory and lived off her hunts. She worked her way up through squirrels and hares and mink and foxes. Eventually she grew tired of them and hunted more dangerous animals like wolves and bears. When unsuspecting travelers came through her woods, she discovered her new favorite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and colorful garments and especially toys when there were little ones. But she could never bring herself to kill the little girls.<br><br>Girls she would take back to her house, deep in the woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke up something deep in her heart. She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own. Among the pillaged wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn’t read, the girls would be tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened firmly to the wall. She couldn’t let them wander off, or they would surely die outside.<br><br>Every time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness. Every time, it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness. She was compelled to try again, and started raiding the nearest villages to slaughter families and kidnap their daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother crafted for her so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children. Villagers spread the legend of a half-beast lurking in Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls.<br><br>War eventually came to the forest. German soldiers began to pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing Russian Empire. During these dark times, there were no more travelers. The villagers had abandoned their homes, and no more little ones to be found; only soldiers. Many of them were found with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously. Once the war was over, the rumours of The Huntress disappeared with it, engulfed by the Red Forest.
    It took two tours in Vietnam, a handful of medals, a knee full of shrapnel, and an honorable discharge to get William "Bill" Overbeck to stop fighting and try to live a peaceful life. He hated it. <br><br>After decades spent drifting aimlessly through dead end jobs, Bill went in for a routine surgery and woke up to find the world he knew was gone. A plague was turning normal people into mindless killing machines. Naturally, the first thing he did was fight his way home and put on his uniform. Making his way through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests, he found other Survivors, and together they fled from the infected hordes. <br><br>In the end, Bill sacrificed himself to ensure their safety. His body was never found. Bill was left for dead. No one knows that he still has the only thing he ever wanted: an enemy to fight.
    From the day that her parents gave Claudette her first science kit, she loved experiments. Her single minded pursuit lead to an early scholarship at a great college. It was a huge decision to leave Montréal, but the chance was too good to pass up.<br><br>Her introverted nature means that chat rooms and forums are now her best source of social interaction. Her new favorite activity is to answer botany questions for others under her new moniker of Science Girl.<br><br>One evening, during a long bus ride back from the city, Claudette took a stroll that would change her life. It only took a minute for her to get completely disoriented in the thick woods. She never found her way back. Her forum only started to wonder where she was a week after she stopped posting.
    Showing exceptional aptitude in psychology, Herman, was handpicked for special training in an advanced neuroscience program located in a secret black site facility in Illinois known as the Léry Memorial Institute, really a front for the CIA. This is where Herman met Dr. Otto Stamper where under his guidance, Herman began to use strange and ever increasingly vicious methods to extract information from prisoners sent to the institute, which was also a covert prison and re-education center for whoever was a USA’s current nemesis. His liberal use of violent electroshock therapy revealed dramatic results and several threats to national security were uncovered.<br><br>Over the years, Herman became known as The Doctor and no one ever questioned if he had even held a medical certificate or even what happened to the prisoners after they had given up their information. It was only after the Léry Memorial Institute went silent for a week that the true horror was finally discovered. The personnel, patients, and prisoners were all found dead with all types of head trauma. All personnels and prisoners bodies were accounted for, including Dr. Otto Stamper, but no sign of Herman “The Doctor” Carter.<br>
    Dwight was geeky and scrawny through high school. He always wanted to be one of the cool kids, but somehow never had the charisma. He tried out for the football team but was cut, the basketball team didn’t even take a look, and his grades were distinctly below average.<br><br>One weekend, on a team building exercise from his dead-end job, Dwight’s boss led them deep into the woods before breaking out his family recipe moonshine. Dwight remembered taking the first sip before waking up late the next morning all alone.<br><br>During the night, the others had abandoned him. Once again, the laughing stock of the community Dwight tried to hike his way out of the woods. That was the last anyone ever heard of Dwight Fairfield.
    Feng Min was a young girl when she first picked up computer games, and she was instantly hooked. Her parents saw no wrong with a few minutes in front of the screen, but as minutes turned into hours and sometimes days, they finally decided to pull the plug and force Feng Min to put more efforts into her studies.<br><br>She felt smothered by parents, so she left home and spent her time in internet cafés and LAN parties where the old rules didn’t apply. She spent hours playing, streaming, competing to rise to the top. In the gaming world, she finally found respect. Nicknamed the “Shining Lion,” she was invited to join a prestigious e-sports team where she found a sanctuary free of the misconceptions and prejudice she had felt from her parents and the non-gaming world.<br><br>Feng Min pushed her limits to prove she was the best. Sleep was less important to her than training. She pushed herself too far, slept too little, and her performance began to slip. She started to lose. At night, she would stay up, tormented by the thought of disappointing her parents… and her fans. She spiraled out of control and fell into a pattern of self-destruction. She started wandering the streets and visiting bars, waking up in places she didn’t remember. One day she woke up somewhere completely different…
    Lisa Sherwood grew up in a quiet town. The people of the village were kind, and the elders helped settle their disputes and keep the old traditions alive. Lisa was particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for safety and good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the woods, a terrible storm struck without warning. In the slick wet darkness, she lost her footing and struck her head. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she watched dark shapes approach between the trees. Soon they were close enough for her to make out their evil, hungry grins.<br><br>They kept her chained to the wall in a flooded cellar. Through the gloom, she could see others, whose open wounds swarmed with flies. They did not survive long once the cannibals began carving bites from their bodies with their rusted blades, but somehow Lisa persisted. Starved and mutilated, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled, and the metal tore through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh oozed viscous yellow pus and bones were visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. She traced the symbols they had taught her. A dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. She chose vengeance.<br>The police search eventually brought them to the old house in the swamp. Its inhabitants had been dismembered and devoured. The elders’ charms were scrawled in blood on the floor. Lisa’s body was never found.<br>
    The son of wealthy landowners Max and Evelyn Thompson, this unnamed boy was an unwanted child born to savage parents. Hideously disfigured, he was shut away from society. So ashamed they were of their son, they bricked him into a room and fed him through a hole in the wall. When the boy escaped, he took his revenge savagely and terribly, slaughtering the parents who had tortured him instead of raising him.<br><br>After the deed was done, he continued to live his life at the farm, taking out his deranged violence on the animals that were allowed to run free. As he finally broke free from his shackles, he ran through the cornfields, chasing and slaughtering whatever he could find. They never found the bodies of Max and Evelyn, but they did find tortured and disemboweled animals, all over the farm. Coldwind Farm was quickly settled and the land split up and sold off. There was never a buyer for the farmhouse. Perhaps because of that sound of a chainsaw you could hear throughout those hot summer nights.<br>
    Growing up the son of a wealthy CEO was always going to put pressure on Jake Park. When his brother graduated with honors from Yale the pressure on Jake intensified. Jake wasn’t just the academic type, but his father never really understood his refusal to embrace the expensive education he lavished upon him. Eventually, Jake rebelled by dropping out of school entirely.<br><br>Now, Jake lives off the grid on the edge of the woods. It’s been years since he spoke to his father but his mother checks in once in a while. It was she who eventually called the police.<br><br>The cops said he got lost in the woods and a search party looked for days, but gave up as bad weather rolled in. Despite passionate pleas from his mother, they never resumed the search and Jake went down in history as another casualty of the woods.
    You never know what really matters in life until you’ve realized it might end soon. Laurie is one of those who just wants a quiet life in the suburbs, hanging out with friends, family and maybe go on a date or two. Laurie is a typical teenager. You could pass her on the street and not think twice. She does her homework and is liked by her friends, teachers and family.<br><br>A simple night of babysitting turns into something that will forever change the course of her young life. A knife swooshing through the air. Screams from afar. Noises that play tricks with her mind. But not Laurie, she’s made of something stronger. Something that won’t give up.
    Perhaps it was her mother that had instilled the fierce streak in her or maybe it was her father that left them when she was a baby.<br><br>Meg excelled at schoolwork but she was off the rails. Fortunately, an athletics coach encouraged her to channel her misspent energy on the track.<br>She motivated herself into becoming a high school star and earned a scholarship to college. When her mother fell ill, Meg decided to give up her chance at college to care for the woman who had raised her.<br><br>One summer’s day, on a long run deep in the woods, Meg vanished. Search as they did, they never found her body.
    Nea grew up in the small town of Hjo in Sweden. She had a happy childhood even though her mom and dad worked hard. As the opportunity to move to the US became a reality, she started acting out. Nea was forced to leave her friends and life behind. <br><br>Nea shied away from what her parents considered “normal”. Instead she took refuge in skate parks, and her tag “Mashtyx” was seen more or less all over her new hometown. <br><br>Nea made a sport out of tagging government buildings, avoiding the fuzz and any other danger with her nimble cat-like abilities. Finally Nea’s parents became used to her disappearing for a few days on end. She may have gone too far when her friends dared her to tag the old Crotus Prenn Asylum one moonless night, as she was never seen again.
    Sally Smithson came to town with dreams of children’s feet and laughter in a wooden home built by her husband Andrew. And one day Andrew’s foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing her life. With no other option, Sally had to find a way but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. She started at the bottom, doing the hard night shift. Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, decades of seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Finally, she could not take it anymore and concepts of purification emerged inside her. As the morning staff arrived one day in September - they found over fifty dead patients in their bed along 4 staff members, also dead. Only Sally had survived the night but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally nowhere to be found.
    Some humans are simply bad seeds. Seeds infused with a distilled and pure form of evil. Michael Myers is one of those seeds. He had no issues with causing the pain of others. Instead, it was exactly what he sought. But even life can be tough on those with minds filled with terror. The difference is just how one goes about to solve those problems.<br><br>For Michael, he had to kill to find some inner peace. As he took his sister’s life, the police found a silent boy dressed as a clown at the scene. When one stumbles upon a growing fire, one does not pour gasoline on it. But this was an action taken by officials that had no idea how it would shape this demon in the boy’s body. Sending Michael to a mental institution was a feeble attempt to save the child. Unsuccessful therapy and nightly screams just made him even more introvert and deranged. People hoped that Michael Myers would end up a parenthesis, soon to be forgotten and buried, a failure that soon were to rot away. But then…he escaped.<br>
    The single child of a wealthy family, David King seemed destined for greatness. While growing up in Manchester, he demonstrated serious potential in both sports and academics, and with his family connections, all doors were open to him. He could have succeeded at anything, if it weren't for his combative nature. David lived for the adrenaline rush of a good fight and would go out of his way to get into one.<br><br>His robustness and athletic abilities led him to rugby, where he could cut loose and really cause a ruckus. King excelled and gained a reputation as a promising, if somewhat reckless, rookie. His meteoric rise came to an abrupt end when he lost his temper and assaulted a referee, earning himself a lifetime ban from the league and cutting short what most people assumed was going to be a long, successful career. King was unconcerned; money was no issue, so he took it as an early retirement and focused on other fun things to do.<br><br>Free from the constraints of a career and enabled by the wealth of his family, David King spent most of his time at the pub, drinking, watching games, and getting into fights. Some might say he was wasting his life away. Not many people knew that he was an occasional "debt collector" or that he fought in clandestine bare-knuckle fight clubs.<br><br>When David King stopped showing up at the pub, the few friends he still had were not surprised. They figured he had finally picked a fight with someone stronger than he was. In a way, they were right.
    Evan MacMillan idolized his father. It wasn’t just that he was heir to a great fortune, it was the way he ran the estate. Raised under his firm hand, Evan had taken to running the workforce with an iron fist. Production was always high and the Macmillan Estate prospered under father and son. As Archie MacMillan’s mental health slowly degenerated, Evan protected him from the herd who wanted a piece of the fortune. No matter what his father asked of him, Evan would do.<br><br>When Archie MacMillan finally snapped, Evan became his enforcer in what would become known as the worst mass murder in modern history. They never proved that Evan lead over a hundred men into those dark tunnels before detonating the explosives and sealing them to their fate. The tale of the MacMillan Estate is a tale of wealth and power gone very wrong. How many victims fell to the hands of father and son is unknown. No record was ever made of what became of Evan MacMillan. His father is another unsolved puzzle, found in the basement of his own warehouse - dead and abandoned.<br>
    Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything other than hope for a new beginning. He was happy as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard where bribed cops turned a blind eye on the somewhat shady business that took place. Ojomo didn’t care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his homeland, and as long as he didn’t get involved, he let things be. He just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A car went in, a small, metallic cube came out.<br><br>It was not until one gloomy day that he, just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged with tied hands and panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo’s boss stopped him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he was explained that he’d been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less every car had a soul in them. This was a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain "clients". Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left, and was never seen again.<br><br>

    People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasn’t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on.<br><br>Kate Denson’s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

    In Dead by Daylight, you can take the role of an unstoppable Killer and hunt 4 Survivors, or play as one of 4 Survivors and try to make it out alive. Read this guide to learn the basics of the game.<br><br>The guide is divided into 3 sections: <b>The Game</b>, <b>The Killer</b> and <b>The Survivors</b>. Each section has information that will help you master whichever role you choose to play. 
    Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric game. Each side in the trial has certain advantages and disadvantages:<br><br><b>The Killer</b> is an unstoppable, solitary monster. Killers see the world from a first person perspective. They each have heightened senses, deadly weapons and a unique power that helps them locate, chase, injure, catch and hook Survivors.<br><br><b>The Survivors</b> are a team of 4. They can choose to cooperate or to look out for themselves. Though they are weak and vulnerable, Survivors can use their small size to quickly vault through windows, leap over pallets, or find hiding spots. The Survivors have a wide third person perspective which gives them an advantage in situational awareness.
    The two roles have very different goals.<br><br><b>The Survivors'</b> goal is to escape the trial. In order to do so, they must find and repair 5 generators. Once they are repaired, the generators power 2 Exit Gates. Each gate has a switch that must be held down for a short time before the gate will open and the Survivors can escape.<br><br><b>The Killer's</b> goal is to find and catch Survivors in order to hang them on sacrificial hooks to be consumed by The Entity. <br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered, the Killer will have the added goal of keeping the Survivors within the Trial until the timer expires. See the <b>Endgame Phase</b> section for more information.
    The Entity is the mighty, malevolent being that created the nightmare realm of trials in which the Killers and Survivors are trapped.<br><br>Not much is known about The Entity, and it is rarely seen, except for when it manifests to claim its sacrificed Survivors. Some claim to have caught a glimpse of it in the deep, dark Fog beyond the trial walls. It was probably just their eyes playing tricks on them.
    The location of the trial is chosen by The Entity. Players can influence The Entity's choice by burning certain offerings. <br><br>Trial locations have certain fixed landmarks, but elements such as player starting locations, generators, chests, totems and exits are placed according to The Entity's whims. Even the terrain itself shifts from trial to trial.
    In Dead by Daylight, there are two distinct roles to play and multiple characters in each role to choose from.<br><br>Each Killer has their own strengths, weaknesses and unique power, whereas Survivors initially vary only in their appearance. However, every Killer and Survivor has 3 unique perks to unlock in their bloodweb which can eventually be taught to other characters.<br><br>Every character comes with its own particular skillset, progression path, loadout and customization options to fit your playstyle. Feel free to experiment!
    The loadout is where you equip your character for the next trial.<br><br><b>Survivors</b> can equip up to 1 item, 2 add-ons for their item, 4 perks and 1 offering.<br><br><b>Killers</b> can equip up to 2 add-ons for their power, 4 perks and 1 offering. The power of the Killer is intrinsic to that Killer and cannot be changed.<br><br>Loadout options are unlocked through a progression system called <b>The Bloodweb</b> by using currency known as <b>Bloodpoints</b> which will be explained later on in this section of the guide.
    Survivors can equip themselves with a variety of useful items. There are items that can accelerate repairs, hinder the Killer, heal oneself or even allow Survivors to escape the trial through a secret door. Survivors may equip one item per trial, and every item can be enhanced by selecting add-ons.<br><br>For more information on items, please see <i>"Items & Add-ons"</i> in <b>The Survivors</b> section of this guide.
    Each Killer has a unique power which dictates how they are meant to be played. Details about the Killer's power can be found in the loadout, and can be customized through add-ons. <br><br>The Killer's identity is hidden in the lobby, so Survivors must adapt their strategies once they find out who they are up against in the trial.
    Offerings are selected in the loadout before the trial and are limited to 1 per player. <br><br>Offerings are burnt at the beginning of the trial in order to influence The Entity and alter how the game will be played.<br><br>Offerings have various effects on the trial, such as increasing bloodpoint rewards, increasing the amount of mist, or changing the number of chests that spawn in the environment. 
    Perks are extra abilities obtainable by Killers and Survivors. They offer new ways to evade, hide, help others, attack, catch and kill, or improve existing abilities. Equip the perks that fit your preferred strategy and playstyle. <br><br>Perks are first found in the bloodweb at level I. They can be improved by collecting them multiple times in the bloodweb, up to level III. Progressing the bloodweb is the only way to unlock and improve perks. Depending on their bloodweb level, characters can equip up 4 to perks per a trial.
    Every Killer and Survivor has a set of 3 unique perks found in their bloodweb at levels <b>5</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>. By levelling up further, characters eventually master their unique perks and can teach them to other characters. These <b>Teachable Perks</b> are found in the bloodweb at levels <b>30</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>40</b>.<br><br>Once a teachable perk is unlocked, the corresponding perk can appear on other characters' bloodwebs. Teachable perks can also be unlocked through the <b>Shrine of Secrets<b>.
    Bloodpoints are earned in trials and are used to unlock rewards in <b>The Bloodweb</b>.<br>Your performance in a trial determines the amount of bloodpoints you earn.<br><br><b>The Survivors</b> earn rewards in 4 categories: "<b>Survival</b>" for staying alive, "<b>Objectives</b>" for repairing generators and working towards escape, "<b>Boldness</b>" for interactions with the Killer, and "<b>Altruism</b>" for helping other Survivors.<br><b>The Killer</b> also has 4 score categories: "<b>Brutality</b>" for hurting Survivors and destroying objects, "<b>Hunter</b>" for finding, chasing and catching Survivors, "<b>Deviousness</b>" for clever use of their powers, and "<b>Sacrifice</b>" for their primary goal: hooking Survivors to The Entity.<br><br>Bloodpoints are added to your player profile and can be used to make progress on <b>any</b> character's bloodweb.
    The Bloodweb is a procedurally generated skill tree. It consists of interconnected nodes which can be unlocked to acquire items, add-ons, offerings, perks and more. You progress through the bloodweb by collecting and spending bloodpoints.<br><br>Each character has their own bloodweb which represents their level and general progress. Collecting all nodes on a bloodweb increases that character's level and generates a new, larger, bloodweb. At level <b>10</b>, The Entity awakens and begins to consume nodes on a character's bloodweb, so players must prioritize the nodes they want to reach before The Entity does. Although the maximum level is capped at <b>50</b>, players can carry on completing bloodwebs and generating new ones indefinitely. <br><br>At level <b>50</b>, a character is eligible for <b>prestige</b>.
    Status effects are positive or negative effects applied to Survivors and Killers. Status effects are represented by icons on the right side of the screen.<br><br><b>Yellow</b> status icons indicate positive effects. <br><b>Red</b> status icons indicate negative effects.<br><br>The intensity of a status is indicated by the number of chevrons on the icon. One chevron indicates the weakest form of an effect, and three chevrons indicate the strongest form.<br><br> A gauge surrounding the icon signifies that the effect is temporary and will be removed once the gauge timer is complete. If no gauge is shown, the effect is permament and may only be removed once a specific condition is met, such as a Killer power timing out or a Hex Totem being cleansed.

    The main objective of a Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. In order to achieve this objective, a Killer should do the following:<br><br><li>Patrol the area and find Survivors.</li><li>Chase, injure and catch Survivors before they escape.</li><li>Carry Survivors to a sacrificial hook and hang them there for The Entity to consume.</li><br>Meanwhile, Survivors will be attempting to repair 5 generators to power the 2 Exit Gates and make their escape. Killers should do everything in their power to stop them. <br>This guide will help you use the Killer's abilities to find Survivors and prevent their escape.<br><br><i>We highly recommend consulting <b>"The Survivors"</b> section of this guide to fully understand the extent of their abilities.</i>
    When the trial begins, the first thing most Killers will try to do is locate some Survivors. Survivors must repair generators to escape, so Killers are likely to encounter Survivors in the surrounding areas. Fortunately, Killers can read the auras of generators that require repairs, allowing them to see their outlines with unlimited range.<br><br>There are 7 generators in a typical trial. Try to find an efficient patrol route to protect them.<br><br>A generator in progress is a good sign that a Survivor is nearby, so Killers should keep their eyes peeled in this situation.<br><br>If the Survivors manage to repair 5 generators or the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered, the Exit Gates regain power and may be opened, allowing the Survivors to escape.<br><br>Once the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> begins, all Generators will be blocked off by the Entity.
    Killers can damage generators that have been partially repaired by getting close and performing the <b>Damage Generator</b> action. This will cause the generator's repair process to degrade over time.<br><br>A generator that is losing progress can be identified by the fiery sparks it emits. This regression is cancelled when a Survivor resumes repairs.<br><br>Once the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> begins all unrepaired Generators become locked and cannot be damaged further.
    The Entity has granted its Killers enhanced senses and the ability to pinpoint Survivors who make noise. When a Survivor fails a Skill Check or rushes an action, Killers receive a visual <b>loud noise signal</b>. This visual effect indicates the loud noise source's location.
    Running Survivors leave tracks only the Killer can see. These tracks last a few seconds before they fade, and can be very helpful for locating and tracking Survivors. 
    A skilled Killer notices any noises made by nearby Survivors. Try hard to listen out for heavy breathing, footsteps, cracking branches, cawing crows, or the sounds of Survivor actions such as healing or sabotage. Following these audio cues efficiently might lead you straight to a Survivor.
    Another way for Killers to track Survivors is by following the bloodstains that they leave behind while injured or dying. Bloodstains are harder to see than scratch marks, but are more accurate and a Survivor cannot stop bleeding until they heal. Blood in front of a locker, for example, is a dead giveaway. Like the scratch marks, bloodstains will disappear after a few seconds. 
    When Survivors are located by the Killer, they'll usually attempt to run and hide. The pursuit that follows is called <b>the chase</b>.<br><br>Most Killers are faster than a Survivor, but Survivors are small, nimble, and have many tricks they can use to gain distance, put obstacles in the Killer's way and break line of sight.<br><br>The Killer's goal is to keep track of the fleeing Survivor and get close enough to land a devastating hit. The chase ends when the Survivor gets far enough away from the Killer, or the Killer incapacitates the Survivor.
    As a chase progresses, Killers develop a boiling <b>bloodlust</b>.<br><br>Bloodlust is a status effect that grants the Killer increased speed. Bloodlust becomes stronger the longer a chase continues, to a maximum of level 3, indicated by 3 chevrons on the status effect icon (see <i>Status Effects</i> in the general section of this guide). <br><br>Bloodlust subsides when a chase ends or a Survivor is successfully hit.
    Vaulting is the action of going through a window or over a pallet. Survivors can vault a window slowly and quietly, or quickly and loudly. By running straight at a window, Survivors can pick up some extra speed for their vault. Most Killers are not in a hurry and only have one window vault speed: <i>slow</i>.<br><br>Pallets are found around the map and can be dropped by Survivors to create obstacles for the Killer. Killers cannot vault over pallets, but they can take time to <b>destroy</b> them by interacting with them.
    Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Killer, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy</b>: The health state in which Survivors start. Successfully attacking a healthy Survivor puts them in the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured</b>: Even though they limp, injured Survivors have the same movement speed as when healthy. They leave behind trails of blood and make lots of noise which makes them easier to find. An injured Survivor who takes a second hit is put into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying</b>: Survivors in the dying state can only crawl and are unable to interact or complete objectives. However, they are still able to escape if they can crawl to a Hatch or open an Exit Gate. Crawling Survivors can be picked up and placed on a hook to be sacrificed. If not healed, they will eventually bleed out and die.
    The Killer can perform two <i>basic attacks</i>: a <b>quick attack</b> and a <b>lunge attack</b>.<br><br><b>The quick attack</b> is performed by simply activating the attack interaction. As the name implies, it is quick but has a very short range.<br><br>The<b> lunge attack</b> is performed by holding down the attack interaction. It provides greater reach, but can take some practice to master.<br><br>Missing an attack triggers a short cooldown during which the Killer's speed is reduced. Killers must be careful to properly aim and time their attacks, or risk allowing Survivors to escape.<br><br>Hitting a healthy Survivor grants them a brief burst of speed. Keep a close eye on their movements during this time in order to continue the pursuit.
    Many Survivor actions can be interrupted, giving the Killer a free grab and pick up. To initiate an interrupt, tap the attack interaction at close range while the Survivor is occupied.<br><br>Injured Survivors can be interrupted while vaulting.<br><br>Lunge attacks do not trigger interrupts.
    Once a Killer catches a Survivor, their next goal is to carry them to a sacrificial hook. <br>While being carried, Survivors can wiggle and attempt to break free. Their struggles will affect the Killer's movements. The Survivor will eventually succeed and escape the Killer's grasp, so there is a limited time to transport the Survivor. Fortunately, Killers are able to see the auras of available hooks while they are carrying Survivors. Try to plan an efficient route.<br><br>Watch out for other Survivors while transporting a victim, as any action that stuns or blinds a Killer will free any carried Survivors.<br><br>If a Killer intentionally drops a Survivor, they will remain in the crawling state. Sometimes dropping a Survivor is the best option.
    The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br> Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only struggle to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.<br><br>A Killer who sacrifices all 4 Survivors in the trial will earn The Entity's favor.
    Hooks can be destroyed under certain circumstances:<br><br><b>Sabotage:</b> Survivors can use tools or perks to destroy hooks, making them unusable.<br><br><b>Sacrifice:</b> A successful sacrifice destroys the hook that was used.<br><br>The Entity will repair sabotaged hooks after a few minutes, but hooks that were used for sacrifice remain destroyed for the remainder of the trial. <br><br>Basement hooks cannot be destroyed.
    Every level features an underground chamber called <b>The Basement</b>. Survivors should fear being hooked there, as it is not an easily accessible location and features only one way in or out, making rescues particularly risky.<br><br>Though it can often prove difficult to carry a Survivor to the basement before they escape the Killer's grasp, it is an attractive location to perform the sacrifice. Whereas other hooks can be sabotaged, the central basement hooks cannot be disabled or destroyed in any way.
    If Survivors manage to repair 5 generators, the 2 Exit Gates become accessible. If this happens, the exit locations are shown to all players. Survivors are shown the exits temporarily, but the Killer will see their locations for the remainder of the trial. Killers can use their knowledge of the exit locations to predict Survivor movements and catch them in the final stretch.<br><br>Survivors must hold down the switch to open the gates before they can escape, which is a time consuming action and a great opportunity for the Killer.<br><br>Opening powered Exit Gates will trigger the <b>Endgame Collapse</b>, encouraging Survivors to leave the Trial or be forcefully sacrificed to the Entity when time expires.
    <b>Memento Moris</b> are Killer-specific offerings which influence The Entity in allowing Killers to kill Survivors with their own hands instead of sacrificing them.<br><br>Memento Moris are a reward from The Entity, and an efficient way to do deal with pesky Survivors, but Killers should not rely on them too often. Without sacrifice, The Entity will eventually become <i>displeased</i>. 
    Killers cannot change their power. However, they can customize it. Killers may equip up to 2 power add-ons in the loadout before the trial, which have a variety of effects on the Killer's power.<br><br>At the end of the trial, any add-ons that were equipped are consumed.
    Killers should be aware of the methods Survivors can use to locate them. Most Killers are very large, making them quite easy to see, but there are some other aspects to Survivor perception that are important to keep in mind:<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> The Survivors have a wide third person perspective. The Survivor player is able to see behind their character and around corners.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> Survivors hear a heartbeat when the Killer approaches. The closer the Killer is, the more intense the heartbeat.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> Survivors can see an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. The stain can give away the Killer's position as well as the direction in which they are looking.<br><br><i>Consult <b>"The Survivors"</b> section of this guide to learn more about the Survivors' abilities.</i>

    The primary objective of a Survivor in a trial is to escape. In order to do so, Survivors must complete the following steps:<br><br><li>Repair 5 generators to power the 2 Exit Gates</li><li>Open one of the 2 Exit Gates by holding down its switch</li><li>Leave the trial area</li><br>Meanwhile, the Killer will be trying to locate, catch and hook Survivors in order to sacrifice them to The Entity.<br>Even though Survivors are vulnerable, they have a very useful set of core abilities to hide from and evade the Killer. This guide will explain how to use them.<br><br><i>We highly recommend consulting <b>"The Killers"</b> section of this guide to fully understand the extent of their abilities.</i>
    Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Survivor, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy:</b> Survivors start the trial in this state. Taking damage while healthy puts Survivors into the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured:</b> While injured, Survivors will bleed and grunt, making them easier to track. Though an injured Survivor limps, their movement speed is the same as when healthy. Taking damage while injured puts a Survivor into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying:</b> While dying, a Survivor's movement is limited to a slow crawl. A crawling Survivor has two options: recover as much health as they can, or crawl to find help. Without the aid of specialized perks, a Survivor cannot recover fully; they will need another Survivor to finish healing them. A crawling Survivor can be picked up by the Killer and brought to a sacrificial hook.
    The Killer downed you and left you to crawl in the dying state? It's not over yet!<br><br>While dying, surviors slowly bleed out. The bleed out progress can be seen below the player's status icon. Dying Survivors can see the auras of their teammates, and vice versa. Dying Survivors can use their teammates' locations to determine whether they should move or attempt to recover.<br><br>Without the aid of specialized perks, a Survivor cannot recover fully on theirown; they will need another Survivor to finish healing them.
    Survivors are very vulnerable and have few methods of fighting back against the Killer. To avoid being caught, they should start by learning how to hide. Basic strategies can include crouching behind obstacles, finding cover in tall grass, tucking into dark corners or getting into lockers. However, to avoid detection, Survivors must gain understanding of the Killer's heightened senses.<br><br><b>Scratch Marks:</b> Running is louder than walking, but the real downside to running is the trail it leaves behind. These scratch marks can only be seen by the Killer. They disappear after a few seconds, but the trail they leave can lead the Killer straight to a running Survivor.<br><br><b>Loud Noises:</b> Some actions, such as window vaults, can be performed quickly or slowly (depending on whether the run button is held). Rushing these actions creates a loud noise signal that the Killer may see and hear. Be aware that these actions will give away your position. <br><br><b>Bloodstains:</b> Injured Survivors leave a trail of blood that is visible to all players. Survivors bleed regardless of whether they are walking or running. Bloodstains disappear after a few seconds.<br><br><b>Crows:</b> Crows are servants of The Entity. Survivors who startle them or get too close will cause them to caw loudly and take flight, which can tip off an attentive Killer.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Checks:</b> A failed Skill Check will create a loud noise signal for the Killer. Be very careful after failing a Skill Check! <br><br><i>Consult <b>"The Killers"</b> section of this guide for more information on the Killer's abilities.</i>
    Most Killers are quite large and easy to spot. However, Survivors do have a few extra situational awareness advantages they can use to increase their odds of survival.<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> Survivors have a versatile third person view which grants them 360 degree situational awareness. It can also be used to look around corners or over obstacles and locate the Killer without being seen.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> The Killer's approach is signalled by a heartbeat. As the Killer gets closer, the heartbeat intensifies. Experienced Survivors can use the Terror Radius to accurately determine the distance between themselves and the Killer.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> The Stain is an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. It is especially good for quickly determining where the Killer is looking. If you are in a chase and see the stain bathing your character in its red glow, don't panic. It's too late.
    While performing actions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging, Survivors will periodically trigger <b>Skill Checks</b>. A Skill Check is a quick challenge that requires the player to tap a button at the right time. There are three possible outcomes for a Skill Check.<br><br><b>Good Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the outlined zone known as the "Good Zone". A good Skill Check allows the action to resume without penalty.<br><br><b>Great Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the filled zone known as the "Great Zone". A great Skill Check allows the action to resume and grants a small bonus towards its progress.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is outside the good or great zone, or the button is not pressed at all. Failing a Skill Check creates a great deal of noise and penalizes the action's progress. <br><br>Survivors should always be focused and ready for a Skill Check to appear. They will hear an audio cue before a Skill Check is triggered.
    The first step to complete in order to escape is to repair the 5 generators. There are a few things to keep in mind while doing so:<br><br><b>Generator Locations:</b> Generator locations are randomly selected before the trial, so they cannot simply be memorized. To find the generators, Survivors can try looking out for the flashing lights above them or listen out for the sounds of partially repaired generators.<br><br><b>Killer Patrols:</b> Killers can see the auras of unrepaired and partially repaired generators. When not engaged in a chase, Killers will often patrol the generators searching for Survivors. <br><br><b>Skill Checks:</b> Survivors should be listening out for the Skill Check audio cue while repairing generators. Failing a Skill Check will cause the generator to explode, which sets back the repair progress and alerts the Killer.<br><br><b>Careful Repairs:</b> Repairing a generator takes time and makes noise that can attract the Killer; Survivors need to be on their guard. It's a good idea to plan one or more escape routes in case the Killer approaches.<br><br><b>The Escape:</b> Once the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, a level-wide siren will alert all players that the Exit Gates can be opened. Survivors will only be shown the exit locations for a limited time, so they will need to remember where they are. Many Survivors have been caught at the end of a trial searching the perimeter for the exit!<br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered before all Generators are repaired then they will become blocked off by the Entity.
    Survivors can increase their chances of escaping by taking care of each other. Here are the main actions that can help:<br><br><b>Healing:</b> Survivors can heal each other, even without a Med Kit.<br><br><b>Rescue:</b> Survivors can rescue each other from The Killer and the hook to prevent the sacrifice from happening. Three types of rescue attempts can be made. Each attempt gives you a scoring event that may also impact your perks, Killer powers, and add-ons.<br>Safe Hook Rescue: The unhooked Survivor is not downed within 10 seconds following the Rescue attempt.<br>Unsafe Hook Rescue: The unhooked Survivor is downed within 10 seconds following the Rescue attempt.<br>Shoulder Rescue: Survivors can attempt to blind or stun the Killer to make them drop a carried Survivor.<br><br>Though it is possible to play and escape as a lone wolf, it can prove more difficult once the other Survivors have been killed.
    Chests can be found during trials. They contain helpful items such as med-kits, toolboxes and flashlights. Searching a chest is a somewhat noisy action that can be completed fairly quickly. <br><br>An opened chest has already been looted and is usually empty.
    With the proper items or perks, Survivors can sabotage the Killer's tools. Strategic sabotage can be useful and even save lives. <br><br><b>Sabotage Hooks:</b> The hooks found around the map (but not in the basement) can be temporarily disabled by sabotage. A sabotaged hook cannot be used by the Killer until it is repaired by The Entity.<br><br><b>Sabotage Tools:</b> Killer objects, such as The Trapper's bear traps, can be permanently destroyed by sabotage.<br><br><b>Cleanse Totems:</b> Cleansing is a specific interaction performed on totems. Cleansing a totem destroys it and disables any Hex that was assigned to it. Cleansing does not require any perks or items.<br><br>These actions generate a great deal of noise and will notify the Killer when they are completed!
    Certain interactions can be accelerated through cooperation, including healing and repairing.<br><br>Cooperation, however, comes at a cost, as a larger group can be easier to spot by the Killer and generate more opportunities for failed Skill Checks that could endanger the entire group.
    When the Killer gets too close, it's time to run! Here are some things to keep in mind about chases:<br><br><b>Killer Speed:</b> Most Killers are faster than Survivors, and in long chases they will gain even more speed due to <b>bloodlust</b> <i>(consult the status effect section of this guide for more details about bloodlust)</i>.<br><br><b>Vaults:</b> Survivors can vault over windows and pallets very quickly. Killers traverse these obstacles slowly, so they can be used by Survivors to gain distance.<br><br><b>Break line of sight:</b> To survive a chase, a Survivor should try to break line of sight and head in a direction the Killer does not expect or cannot anticipate.<br><br><b>Pallets:</b> Pallets are objects the Survivors can throw down in order to put an obstacle between themselves and the Killer. Killers can be stunned by dropping a pallet on them directly. Pallets can only be dropped once, after which they can be vaulted by Survivors or destroyed by Killers.<br><br>Keeping these points in mind will help you make it out of the chase alive.
    When the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, the Exit Gates power up and become accessible. Their positions will be temporarily revealed to the Survivors. To open the gate, its switch must be held down for a few seconds. This is a crucial movement, as Survivors are exposed and vulnerable during this time. There's a good chance the Killer will head straight for one of the exits as soon as they become powered. If a Survivor lets go of the switch it will start regressing<br><br>Once the gate is opened, Survivors can go through and escape. Survivors may also choose to stay in the trial and help other Survivors escape, but the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> will require they leave before the timer expires, or else the Entity will take them forcefully. Taking the risk of staying for others in need is a great way to earn more bloodpoints and a good reputation.
    In order to sacrifice a Survivor, the Killer must pick them up and transport them to a sacrificial hook. During this time, the Survivor can wiggle to hinder the Killer's movement and attempt to escape his grasp.<br><br>A successful grasp escape puts a Survivor right back on their feet and stuns the Killer briefly, giving them a narrow chance to escape.
    The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br>Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only fight to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.
    Survivors have access to a variety of useful items. Only one item can be equipped in the loadout, but it can be customized with up to two item add-ons.<br><br>Item use is limited to its amount charges, which is indicated in the bar next to the item icon in the HUD. When fully depleted, the item is consumed, along with its add-ons.<br><br>If a Survivor dies during a trial, any carried items and add-ons are lost. If a Survivor escapes, any items they were carrying, along with their add-ons, will be banked in that Survivor's inventory.
    The Hatch is a secret door that offers an alternative way for Survivors to escape. The Hatch appears mysteriously and is usually closed and locked. A Survivor with a skeleton key can open the Hatch for themselves and their fellow Survivors. <br><br>The Hatch will also open in the event that only one Survivor remains in the trial. <br><br>Killers can close an opened Hatch to trigger the <b>Endgame Collapse</b>.

    The Doctor
    Whether Killers perform their heinous acts by the compulsions of their diseased minds, or if they are forced into them by external pressures, has long been a matter of debate. But for one Killer, nature and nurture are inextricably linked.<br><br>Leatherface kills not from a desire to exert his will over others, to satisfy carnal urges, or even to quiet the voices in his head. He kills because he is scared. Scared that others will hurt him; scared that his family will be displeased with him, scared that their shared willingness to eat human flesh will be discovered.<br><br>He does as he is told, his family loves him and that is all that matters. Outsiders are a threat, and threats need to be dealt with. <br><br>Like those kids that came into the house, uninvited. Walked in like they owned the place. Looked around the house, trying to find out his family’s secrets, no doubt. But Leatherface dealt with them, protected his family, just as he’d been taught.<br><br>He is not just protector, he has many roles, and each role has its own face. He serves dinner, cares for the family, dresses well when they eat. His Grandpa and Ma used to care for them all, but Grandpa is old now and she has been still for a while, so Leatherface and his brothers had to take over. Family is everything to him. Family is security and safety. <br><br>But, even though he did his best, one of the kids got away. He tried to stop her, chasing after her as fast as he could, but she had help: another outsider, driving a truck. The evil trucker killed his brother, ran him over like he was a possum. In a fury, Leatherface leapt at him, the saw ready to avenge his family, but the trucker was too quick. He knocked Leatherface aside and turned his own saw against him. <br><br>As he watched the outsiders driving away, the rage, grief and pain combined with the worry about what would happen to his family now. They would surely return with the police, and the police would take his brothers, his Grandpa. Without them, what would he do? Without their commands, he would wither and die.<br><br>As his world collapsed, Leatherface spun in circles, swinging the saw all around, trying to fight off the myriad external threats that surrounded him.<br><br>Then another feeling overtook him. It came from outside his vision, crawling over his skin with cold dread. He realised that no matter what outsiders could do to him, there was something worse, something bigger that lived in the shadows. He was filled with a terror unlike any he had ever felt before. But it was almost comforting, like the fear he’d felt with his family. The fear of disappointing them.<br><br>He was brought to a place that was familiar but unknowable, and he instinctively knew what he had to do. He couldn’t fail it, the way he had his family. Outsiders would come but he would use his skills to overcome any threats. There would be screaming, but he could make the world quiet again. Until the only sound remaining was the blessed howl of the saw.<br><br>Let the outsiders come.
    The Cannibal
    When John Kramer, better known as Jigsaw, planned for his son to be born during the Chinese Zodiac’s Year of the Pig, he wanted it to represent fertility and rebirth; a new beginning for him and his wife, and the start of a charmed life for his son. But that plan was shattered on the night that a junkie broke into his wife’s clinic, hoping to score. <br><br>After this event resulted in the death of his unborn son, John finally caught up with the junkie, making him his first test subject, and the Pig was changed forever too. It became a representation of the disease that was rotting John from the inside, a reminder that we are just meat unless we elevate ourselves through our actions, by grasping life from the jaws of death.<br><br>The Pig became a vessel, an agent of Jigsaw, conveying the subjects to their test. For some of those who emerged victorious, the Pig could still be a rebirth, into their new lives as apprentices, even disciples, of Jigsaw. <br><br>That was the case for Amanda Young, a troubled soul, whose life had been a catalogue of harm, both to herself and those around her. That changed when she faced, and bested, Jigsaw’s test. Deciding her life was worth something, she became devoted to Jigsaw’s cause, ready to take over when the cancer consumed him.<br><br>But she became more dependent on John, her anguish at his impending death combining with a belief that their test subjects weren’t capable of saving themselves, of being reborn in the crucible of the games. <br><br>Seeing this, John presented her with another game, another chance to save herself, but Amanda let her rage and jealousy rule her actions. She failed the test and took a bullet as a consequence. <br><br>Bleeding out on the tiled floor, darkness engulfed Amanda’s vision, accompanied by a sound like creaking wood. Then she was in a forest, once more viewing the world through the eyes of a Pig. Trees surrounded her, their branches clawing at her from all sides. Waves of panic washed over her and she could hear her breath reverberating inside the mask.<br><br>Had she been damned, cursed to spend her days here, in this guise? Or maybe this was another test? Maybe she hadn’t failed at all? John always thought one step ahead of everyone else, planned for every eventuality, and he would never give up on her, surely?<br><br>Jigsaw may have gone but he had passed her onto another. A being for whom she would be The Pig again.<br><br>Ultimately, she saw now that she had been right in the choices she had made. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption for any of them. They were meat, and meat was destined for slaughter.

    Kenneth Chase was born in 1932 by a difficult labor, which his mother wouldn’t survive. This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did his father’s resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.<br><br>Academically, he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax him into team sports.<br><br>On his walk home from school, he would often find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers’ barbs and feeling the softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon procuring some anesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.<br><br>After a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once it recovered from the anesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection, discarding the others as ‘fake’.<br><br>By the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customizing the anesthetic dosage for each.<br><br>In early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth’s father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man’s finger.<br><br>Returning from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.<br><br>After a few weeks of living rough, he encountered a traveling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes. He assumed a new name: Jeffrey Hawk.<br><br>Suddenly surrounded by a close-knit community, “Jeffrey” had to learn to socialize. He donned a new personality like a disguise, quickly becoming known as charming and helpful, and was welcomed into his new family.<br><br>Over the next decade, he stayed with the circus, traveling the length and breadth of the USA. But, with the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drink, junk food, drugs, he indulged all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and makeup from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get close to his victims before he anesthetized them, bringing them back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams fueling him, before being lost in the night.<br><br>Once their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest. Once he found the best, he would cut it from their hand and proudly add it to his collection, disposing of the rest of the body as pointless waste.<br><br>Men, women, young, old, he didn’t care. The essence of a good collection is in the variety, in the memories and stories they evoke.<br><br>He removed the costume less and less, shedding his old personality with it, fully embracing the clown, his true self.<br><br>With time, he became complacent and sloppy. A victim managed to work free of her bindings while he was sleeping off the drink. She escaped, screaming for help, and he awoke to find the rest of the circus bearing down on him. He whipped his horse and the caravan disappeared into the night.<br><br>Since then he has roamed the country, a parasite who could always be found at a carnival or circus, but who would never been seen on any playbill. He lured those brave, or foolish, enough to come near, trapped them and moved on before they could be found missing.<br><br>Somewhere along the way, he left the ordinary roads of the USA behind him, traveling through a veil of mist and entering a new realm. It was a place of transience and impermanence, perfectly suiting the life he had chosen to lead. Feeling more at home than he had in his entire life, he set up camp and waited for his first visitor.

    Frank Morrison was nineteen and had little to show for it. He’d stopped attending school after being kicked out of the basketball team for shoving a referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a man of potential, who could light up a room despite his bleak childhood. At six years old, he’d been taken away from Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times he’d lashed out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they’d kept moving him to new, unfamiliar houses. His last move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, Clive Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption center. They’d been on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest time they’d spend together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family Services for drinks at the bar.<br><br>Ormond was a small, stale place; a remote town of six thousand inhabitants where gray winters drag on for most of the year. Frank did everything he could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed his mind when he caught the attention of a beautiful girl. Julie was a popular girl who was convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as an outsider, was her ticket out. Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naive Susie, who was Julie’s best friend.<br><br>They would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Bullying, vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joe to vandalize the store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough as the building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank. He rushed to her aid knife in hand and, without hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner’s back.<br><br>As the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Jo clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn’t want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they’d started. Julie closed her eyes and jabbed the knife into the man’s chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man’s throat. Frank told them to move fast: they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the trunk of Joe’s car and drove up Mount Ormond.<br><br>All four were digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled on an ominous trail. He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness.  Julie, Susie, and Joe finished digging but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joe did not return home that night, their parents thought they’d run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory. The mood of the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.

    Danny Johnson, known as Jed Olsen by some, grabbed the newspaper from the kitchen counter: it was a week old, but his face was on the front page, grainy and sunken. It was one of those muggy afternoons in Florida when heat and humidity permeated everything in the kitchen, making him sweat while standing still. He slouched in a damp chair to read. This article had better be good—his work in Roseville had been outstanding.<br><br><i><b>GHOST FACE DISAPPEARS</b></i><br><br>June 18, 1993<br><br>At first glance, Jed Olsen was a modest and enthusiastic freelancer with experience in a variety of small newspapers. The staff at the Roseville Gazette appreciated how easy-going and honest he seemed, and so he was treated as a stranger for no more than five minutes into his interview:<br><br>“Jed quickly spotted the editor-in-chief in the room, gave him a wide smile and a firm handshake, and talked about good old American values. And that was it, he was in.”—Ex-Contributor at the Roseville Gazette<br><br>Olsen never justified his erratic career path, which zigzagged between several small towns from Utah to Pennsylvania. There was no verification of his previous jobs. He had a decent portfolio plus a good attitude, and they needed a contributor right away.<br><br><b>THE ROSEVILLE MURDERS</b><br><br>Olsen had been working at the newspaper for five months when the Roseville Murders began: victims from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. From the reports, the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.<br><br>The murderer also liked to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he’d visit the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.<br><br>The whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story. Olsen was often sent to interview the family of victims and relay official statements from the police. Unknown to everyone at the time, his involvement added to the final body count.<br><br><b>THE GHOST FACE</b><br><br>Panic swelled in Roseville when Olsen produced footage of a hooded figure breaking into a house at night. The masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. “Ghost Face Caught on Tape” was the resulting article, written by Olsen. He seemed proud of his work at the time, enjoying how the whole town feared his ghost stories.<br><br>Weeks later, Olsen left a note on his work desk and disappeared:<br><br>“I hope you liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life. Don’t worry, I'm not done.” –Jed Olsen<br><br>The Roseville law enforcement still refuses to comment as Jed Olsen remains at large. <br><br>Danny smiled, ripping out the article from the newspaper. When the investigation had been pointing to him, he’d packed his bags and left Roseville swiftly.<br><br>He got up, the clammy seat pulling his skin. An oppressive humidity engulfed him as he entered the bedroom. Condensation dribbled on a small misted-up window as bits of cracked wallpaper hung limply. Its floral pattern was covered with gruesome photos and newspaper headlines. Danny pinned the week-old article on top of a picture of lacerated scalps. A faint pang of hunger hit him, and he wondered when he had eaten last. Was it this morning, while washing his knife and clothes? Or was it last night, after following that girl down the street? He couldn’t remember clearly.<br><br>Taking a step back, he admired his work on the wall. His mind drifted, remembering all the articles he’d written, the stories he’d planned, and the scenes he’d brought to life.<br><br>A shiver ran through him. A chilling breeze transformed the bedroom's humidity into an opaque, freezing Fog. A woman shrieked. Dead leaves crunched under his feet.<br><br>He smiled in anticipation.

    When she was five years old, Adiris, the youngest of a family of seven, was left on the brick-red burning steps of the Temple of Purgation at the center of Babylon. To process her shock and sorrow, she held onto the belief that the gods had a plan for her. Her new life was one of quiet servitude. She would tend to the gardens, prepare ceremonial meals, and polish ceremonial incense burners. At night, she would pray for a sign that would reveal her purpose.<br><br>When she came of age, she attended the high-ranking priests during the yearly worshiping of the sea-goat, the god of water and creation. Swinging a censer down the great hypostyle hall, she cast thick black fumes that reached the cold towering stone pillars before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting bliss made her feel closer to the gods than ever. She worked herself to the bone each day that followed, fulfilling her duties while taking on new ones, as she aided the priests during purification rituals.<br><br>The priests were more and more in need of assistance. Cleansings were being performed daily to answer the demand from outside the high temple walls, where a catastrophic plague had resurfaced. Within months, the priests contracted the disease. It did not take long before they became too weak to perform any kind of ritual. Adiris, having assisted many purification rituals, was the only one able to carry on. The swelling panic had to be contained, even if by a novice.<br><br>Anxious before her first ceremony, Adiris visited the priests’s sanctuary chamber. When she lit the candles, she noticed a narrow opening at the back. Sliding through the gap, she reached a crypt hidden under the sanctuary. The chamber was bare except for the golden statue of a woman, who stood with outstretched hands, her fingers covered in jewels. It was the sign Adiris had been waiting for.<br><br>The great hall was packed with followers who bowed down as Adiris entered. She strode to the brick altar and grabbed a ceremonial dagger forged in silver, her ruby ringed fingers wrapping around the blade like claws. The sudden display of luxury intrigued the followers, who were struck already by her youth and beauty.<br><br>As she began reciting the epic of creation, a woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and noticed the black blisters covering her feet. Without hesitation, Adiris grabbed her sacred blade and swung it at her own foot, severing a toe. Then she offered the bloody part to the gods, asking them to protect the woman.  A silence fell over the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess.<br><br>Tales of her wealth, beauty, and devotion began to spread across the city as quickly as the disease.  Soon, Adiris’s followers called her the High Priestess of Babylon.<br><br>But her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood, her neck erupted in abscesses, and her four-toed foot darkened. Ashamed of her condition, she began wearing a veiled headpiece and carried a censer that masked the rancid smell of sick that clang to her skin. Hoping to be saved, she kept performing the rituals, offering blessed water and food to her followers.<br><br>But no ritual could save her. In a desperate attempt to appease the gods, Adiris banished herself from the city. She traveled north with a few followers, venturing through the cold woodlands of Urashtu, until it was no longer possible to walk.<br><br>They camped in a damp cave, where Adiris lay in a pool of vomit. Her foot, which had turned black, was so swollen she could not go any further. Her followers and she realized the truth in that cave: they were all infected with the plague.<br><br>Kneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one last prayer. The black fumes of incense rose into the damp air before being wiped off by a cold breeze.<br><br>Neither the body of Adiris nor her followers were ever found. Many told tales of her return, but no one truly knew what fate had befallen the High Priestess of Babylon.

    A blooming mouth full of needle-like teeth for a face, large, curved, razor-sharp claws, and powerful legs to pounce on victims, make The Demogorgon a frightening monster to face in any dimension. It is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage as it hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces, devouring every last morsel of flesh and gore, leaving nothing for scavengers. The creature is untouched by any sense of compassion or restraint. Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the pure instinct of its insatiable bloodlust as it delivers the deathblow. A perfect hunter, The Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking in the Upside Down and why it was choice pickings for The Entity.

    Even while he lived, Freddy Krueger was a creature of nightmare for those who truly knew him. Hiding behind a mask of warmth and friendliness, Freddy’s actual temperament was known only to his victims. When those victims were finally heard, the parents of Springwood tracked Freddy down and took the law into their own hands. They thought fire had rid them of a monster that night, that their children were finally safe, but evil as strong as his has a way of surviving. <br>Years passed, the horror was buried, the victims mercifully forgot. Then, somehow, Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.<br>Freddy focused his anger on those he felt had wronged him, building up to his one true obsession: Nancy Holbrook. But he underestimated her strength and resourcefulness. Together with her friend, Quentin, she managed to weaken Freddy, mutilating him and leaving him for dead once more. <br>Death didn’t want Freddy the first time he encountered it, why did they think it would take him now? He emerged once more, consumed with vengeance. Then he turned his sights on the boy who had blocked his path to Nancy, his number one. <br>Freddy invaded Quentin’s dreams, terrorising him night after night, until his strength and defences would be at their lowest. When the time was right, he forced the boy to return to the dark reflection of Badham Preschool. Here he would have his final revenge.<br>Freddy stalked the boy through the school’s halls. He took his time, savoring every moment of the hunt. This was what he enjoyed the most: the smell of their sweat in the air, the ragged gasps of their terrified breath. They were his to play with. <br>There was the boy, at the end of a long corridor. Too tired and scared to run anymore? Resigned to his fate? Freddy closed in, arms wide, claws raking the wall. Their tips traced along a pipe, the metallic shrieking only adding to the boy’s apprehension.<br>A shower of sparks rained on the ground, and into the liquid that covered the tiled floor. A blue flame blossomed and quickly engulfed the room.<br>The boy took flight as Freddy burst from the flames in a fury. Rooms and walls raced past in a blur until they were in Freddy’s basement. There would be no escape from here.<br>Slowly Freddy closed in on the boy. His fear was so strong now that Freddy could almost taste it, but his eyes burned with a defiant hatred that was almost admirable. <br>Freddy drew back his claws.<br>Then Freddy felt another presence with him; something old, powerful and dark. A miasma enveloped him and the only sensation was a sound like wooden beams flexing and creaking in the distance. The echoing groan of metal crushed against metal. Something arcane and unknowable, half-way between language and pure terror. <br>There was a moment of falling and spinning, and then Freddy was back in the school. But not his school. It looked the same, but it felt different. His powers were tempered in some ways and focused in others. The boy had gone for now, but other prey walked the hallways. Some would be inconsequential; others would become his new favorites. All would fall before his claws.

    Rin was the only child of the Yamaoka family. She was raised in the dusty halls of a traditional house in Kagawa. She studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed heavily on her family’s shaky finances. Her mother got ill that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked part-time in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.<br><br>Her father faced a debt that grew without end. He started working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion. That’s when he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night, Rin’s father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and explained his situation. He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.<br><br>His request was denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had to be held accountable and Rin’s father fitted the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.<br><br>That evening, Rin came home from work. She’d stayed late to entertain customers that lingered at the restaurant. As she parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother’s scream from the house.<br><br>She rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her parents’ room. There she found bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her limbs were clean-cut, tangled up in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced up, revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.<br><br>A sharp katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her bare forearm. The shock of recognition interrupted her pain: her father was wielding the katana with a stoic expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm again.<br><br>She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the doorframe as support, she raised herself up. The katana ripped through the wall, cleaving her other arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway, only to be met by her father’s blade.<br><br>She stepped back, trembling, as she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen. Images of her mother’s tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.<br><br>Rin charged at her father, making him stumble back. He punched her torn abdomen and she reclined in pain. As she struggled to get back up, he slashed her thigh, making her collapse on the floor.<br><br>As she crawled towards the stairs, he grabbed her hair and yanked her against a partition. The glass shattered on impact and she fell through, landing one floor down.<br><br>She heard footsteps somewhere above her. With effort, she moved, worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The shards gnawed at her, ripping her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would not get away with what he’d done to her—with what he’d done to her mother.<br><br>Coughing up blood, her chin grazed the glass, adding to the bleeding. A low-pitched heartbeat started to ring in her ears. Her body felt so heavy she could no longer move.<br><br>The ground shook with her father’s footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.<br><br>A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest—not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.<br><br>An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.

    The Cannibal: You can quickly destroy pallet with your Chainsaw.
    The Cannibal: Your Chainsaw attack can down more than one Survivor at once. Use it on groups to a devastating effect.
    The Cannibal: Be careful not to run in obstacles while using the Chainsaw as you'll get stunned in a tantrum.
    The Cannibal: While stuck in a tantrum after hitting an obstacle with your Chainsaw, your Chainsaw is still deadly.
    The Cannibal: Hitting Survivors with your Chainsaw downs them instantly.
    The Pig: Use the Active Ability button to crouch, mute your Terror Radius and sneak up on Survivors.
    The Pig: While crouched, use your attack to launch a sprint attack. Hold down the attack interaction to perform a longer sprint.
    The Pig: Put traps on dying Survivors. They activate when a generator is fired up and give 2.5 minutes in which Survivors must find the correct key in Jigsaw Boxes or be instantly sacrificed.
    The Pig: A Survivor with a Reverse Bear Trap on their head is killed if they attempt to escape through the Exit Gate, but only if the trap is activated.
    The Pig: You have a limited number of Reverse Bear Traps for the Trial. You cannot get more during the Trial.
    The Clown: Use the Active Ability Button to reload your The Afterpiece Tonic ammunition. You may only carry a limited amount of The Afterpiece Tonic so be strategic about when you reload. Try to have enough bottles ready before engaging in a chase.
    The Clown: Aiming directly at Survivors may be a challenging shot to hit so try to anticipate their movement by throwing bottles in a way that it will block their escape options. Aim at environment objects like window frames, trees and ceilings to surprise them and force them away from certain areas of the map.
    The Clown: Hitting a Survivor directly with a bottle causes him to be even more visually impaired.
    The Clown: Survivors entering your deadly clouds are momentarily hindered, slowing them down for a brief moment and blocking them from performing rushed actions. The Clown is completely immune to his own toxic gas cloud effects.
    The Clown: Hold down the Power button to throw The Afterpiece Tonic further. This can be cancelled at any time by tapping the Attack button.
    The Spirit: While using Yamaoka’s Haunting, you cannot see Survivors or their blood trails, but you can see their scratch marks. Use them to track down Survivors before reappearing.
    The Spirit: While charging Yamaoka’s Haunting, you may not move. Position yourself so that you can spot and cut off the Survivors' escape route once your power is fully charged.
    The Spirit: If you stay still, feigning to charge Yamaoka’s Haunting, you can trick Survivors into thinking that you have left the area.
    The Spirit: Yamaoka’s Haunting can be used in short bursts. The recharge time is based on the remainder of the power bar.
    The Spirit: Use the husk to block the Survivor's path or interaction points, such as vaults or pallets.
    The Legion: Once you have hit a Survivor and inflicted the Deep Wound status effect, look around you and make use of your Killer Instinct to help locate nearby Survivors.
    The Legion: Hitting a Survivor and inflicting the Deep Wound status effect will fully replenish your Power gauge.
    The Legion: While Feral Frenzy is active, you can vault windows faster, and you can also vault pallets.
    The Legion: While Feral Frenzy is active, hitting a Survivor already affected by the Deep Wound status effect will completely deplete your power gauge.
    The Legion: Hitting a Survivor with your basic attack will  deplete a portion of your power gauge.
    The Plague: Use Pools of Devotion corrupted by sick Survivors to turn your Vile Purge into a deadly toxin that can damage Survivors. This effect only lasts for a short duration.
    The Plague:Healthy Survivors who are infected will become injured when their infection indicator is completely filled.
    The Plague:Using Vile Purge on Survivors is often the most effective way to increase a Survivor's level of infection. While infected, a Survivor also increases their own level of infection by running or performing interactions like repairing.
    The Plague:Use Vile Purge on objects such as generators or pallets to infect them. Using Corrupt Purge only injures Survivors, but does not infect them or other objects. 
    The Plague:Any Survivors that are completely infected transmit their sickness and cause objects and other Survivor they interact with to become infected as well.
    Try to stay hidden! Survivors can affect your ability to stay in stealth mode if they reveal you while Night Shroud is active.
    While Night Shroud is active you are able to stalk and eventually Mark your victims! Marking a Survivor will apply the exposed status effect for a short duration.
    Use the Active Ability button to toggle crouch mode. While crouched, you move slower but are harder to detect, especially if Night Shroud is active!
    Move to the edge of a wall or object in the environment and hold the Power button while Night Shroud is active to lean out of cover and stalk your victims.
    If you are revealed by a Survivor you will be briefly notified by Killer Instinct that shows the general direction in which they are located.
    The Demogorgon: If a portal has been opened but not traveled through, it cannot be seen or destroyed by the Survivors.
    The Demogorgon: Use your Shred action to close the distance on unsuspecting Survivors. The longer you charge it, the further it reaches.
    The Demogorgon: When emerging from a portal, you are affected by the Undetectable status effect for a few seconds. Survivors won't hear you coming!
    The Demogorgon: While traveling through portals, you can still see generator and Survivor auras to help you maintain spacial awareness.
    The Demogorgon: Fully charge your power to activate Of The Abyss and detect any Survivors within proximity to your portals.
    The Nightmare: Your Dream Snares will slow Survivors as well as block Survivors from being able to Fast Vault window vaults.
    The Nightmare: Hitting an awake Survivor will put that Survivor to sleep. The outline of sleeping Survivors are highlighted in a bluish tint. Sleeping Survivors can trigger your Dream Abilities.
    The Nightmare: An awake Survivor can wake up a sleeping Survivor, each time a Survivor is woken up, the Wake Up action will take longer and longer. Survivors can also wake up by failing skill checks. Use this to your advantage as this will reveal their location.
    The Nightmare: Sleeping Survivors hear your lullaby instead of the Terror Radius, this makes it harder for Survivors to know where you are and where you are coming from.
    The Nightmare: When channeling Dream Projection, the targeted generator will spew blood and a Dream Projection of The Nightmare will start to appear by the generator. Use this to scare Survivors off a generator, cancelling the channel puts Dream Projection on a reduced cool down.
    The Clown can hurl glass bottles that explode on impact, releasing a toxic gas cloud across a large area. Survivors should avoid entering the gas as it affects vision, movement speed, and causes excessive coughing, notifying The Killer.
    Facing The Clown
    When The Demogorgon travels through a portal, a global map sound is emitted. Use this notification to stay alert during those moments! When The Demogorgon arrives at its destination, it is undetectable and doesn't emit a terror radius. It can also 'Shred' Survivors from a distance.
    Facing The Demogorgon
    Keep your eyes open in case Ghost Face is nearby. You can reveal him when in a close proximity if you look at him for a short duration. This will deactivate his stealth power but may let him know you are near!
    Facing Ghost Face
    If The Legion hits you while their power is active, you will be affected by the Deep Wound status effect. Stop and use the Mend action to remove the effect, or find another Survivor so they can assist you. Stay out of The Legion's Terror Radius when they inflict Deep Wounds - they can sense your location.
    Facing The Legion
    The Nightmare's Dream Snares and Dream Pallets are effective against sleeping Survivors. Interact with your highlighted Alarm Clock to wake up; using the Alarm Clock will pause the sleep timer for 30 seconds before beginning to fall asleep again.
    Facing The Nightmare
    While crouching, The Pig has no Terror Radius and may launch an ambush attack. She can place Reverse Bear Traps on dying Survivors which activate when a generator is fired up. Survivors must find the right key in a Jigsaw Box or be killed.
    Facing The Pig
    While infected, use the Pools of Devotion found within the environment to cure yourself. If you wait too long and and your infection indicator becomes filled, you will be afflicted by the Broken status effect.
    Facing The Plague
    The Spirit phases out for a short time when using her power. While on the move, she cannot see Survivors or their blood trails. Listen out for an eerie sound to know if she is nearby.

    Nestled in a quiet part of the grounds, Father Campbell’s Chapel was a haven from the horrors of the rest of the asylum. Those patients whose illnesses were less severe were given the run of the place and many would come here for refuge, to communicate with God and confess their sins.<br><br>Sadly, Father Campbell’s legacy of good works counted for nothing when the Nurse’s mind snapped, and he drew his final breath in the confessional that had helped so many.<br><br>Now the chapel has been joined by a strange companion: a carny’s caravan, pulled by a shadowy horse. It has long traveled through The Fog, moving from realm to realm, and now temporarily camps here.<br><br>Beware: only a fool would let the bright colors seduce them into visiting.
    Father Campbell's Chapel
    The last standing structure after the fire that still shows the grandeur of the original architecture. Its two floors and dark basement leave behind nothing of the tale of horrors that took place here. Nothing but memories linger in the abandoned rooms.
    The Office is where money changed owners and hands were shook. The heavy duty safe in the floor might have been a dead giveaway to the shady business that took place. Wads of cash were hidden all over the place. Stating that money wasn’t an issue, maybe people got executed for enjoyment, rather than wealth.
    A run-down log cabin at the edge of the scrap yard and the home of its owner. Weird carvings and etchings in the wall perhaps say more about the owner’s state of mind and allude to his disappearance. Reports suggested that prisoners were held in its dark basement before they were taken to the crusher.
    The Junkyard is packed with sharp objects. Walking around the area, aware of the bloodbath that took place here, changes the landscape. Blood-covered metal and bits of flesh abound. One does not willingly walk amongst all this evidence of death.
    This old garage was once not just a place of death and execution. Automobiles were actually repaired here amongst oil mixed with blood. But as investigators found out about the atrocities that took place, it became forgotten.
    For decades, Azarov’s Gas Heaven offered the last chance for travellers to rest and fuel up before the long, hard haul through the backcountry. Wiser travellers learned to decline that offer. The phones never worked and people had a peculiar habit of going missing. When the highway came through, bypassing Gas Heaven entirely, business dried up and the gas station was abandoned. No one quite knows how many bodies are stashed out there, or what else is hidden in the ruins of the old rest stop.
    Once part of the farm, the Slaughterhouse was still in operation for many years after the breakup of the farmland. Rotting stench and stained floors provide proof of all the deaths that have taken place here… Animal or otherwise.
    The Silo is one of the oldest remaining buildings that made up Coldwind farm. The great storm of 2003 brought the ancient structure crashing down. It was weeks later that searchers discovered twelve bodies were buried in the ruins. Their crushed corpses were buried deep in the slurry that oozed out from the base and made identification almost impossible.
    Even before the fall of Coldwind Farm, the cornfields were surrounded by tales of ominous myths. Everything from mutilated animals to red corn stalks. Now it’s abandoned, but still, someone seems to care for the corn in some way as the stalks still stand tall.
    The centerpiece of Coldwind Farm, the Farmhouse stood proudly over the fields of golden corn for decades. After the horrific events of 1972, the building fell into disrepair and eventual ruin. The Farmhouse is now nothing more than a forgotten, former home where holidays were once celebrated.
    The old run-down cowshed was one of the first barns the Thompsons built on Coldwind Farm. It was originally intended to house sick animals at a safe distance from the rest of the livestock, but no animal who entered it ever survived. An investigation revealed the building was infested with toxic mold. The Thompsons figured it must be a construction fault or something to do with the dampness of the wood. A new barn was built, and the old cowshed was left to rot in the shadows.
    Ormond was once a small, remote ski town with idyllic slopes, but its resort turned obsolete when a deluxe ski village was built on Mount Richards less than two hours away. Mount Richards offered fresh slopes with luxurious stores and hotels, which crushed Mount Ormond’s isolated, decrepit facilities.<br><br>The fate of the mountain worsened when a mining project took interest in the coal present at its summit. The mountaintop was lined by explosives to extract coal seams from under it. The project caused a public outrage and was stopped midway.<br><br>Mount Ormond is now a soulful, deforested graveyard where gangs and teenagers go looking for trouble. Some people say that the mountain hides a darkness, a bottomless hole from where no one can return.
    Mount Ormond Resort
    This industrial warehouse is the product of a fevered mind, desperately trying to complete their life’s work, their legacy, before their inevitable end. A place of both, creation and destruction, from which devices of death and rebirth were produced. The smell of fear, blood and death has soaked into the brick walls. The sickly glow of fluorescent lighting bathes the room where Jigsaw has planned out his final trial.<br><br> The game begins.
    The Game
    A simple street with houses that witnessed the horrors that took place. A jungle gym where children once learned to climb. Sidewalks where fathers taught their daughters to ride a bike. All gone. Instead it sits in the palm of The Entity, forever held in darkness.
    A mansion from the late 1800's - donated and transformed into a medical facility and later into a CIA black site specializing in cutting-edge interrogation techniques. The institute closing is shrouded in controversy and mystery. At the heart of the facility, the Doctor’s tools have been arranged in a twisted ritual circle, ready for research, as he refines his methods on an endless stream of terrified patients.
    Located below the Hawkins National Laboratory, this underground complex released dozens of interdimensional creatures in November 1984, before the rift was sealed.<br><br>The site kept some vestiges of its past as the mental health institute, including a moldy isolation tank used by patients suffering from acute anxiety that was later modernized for mind control experimentation on promising test subjects.<br><br>Now the walls of the abandoned facility are sprayed with bullets and blood, evidence of a battle against interdimensional creatures.
    The Underground Complex
    The Pale Rose, an ancient paddle steamer in the middle of the swamp, is held captive by the stagnant mud. It has been here long before the residents began their hunt, a barely visible silhouette from the nearby village. There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor. From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here.
    Treatment Theatre
    You can still see the tiny entrance that miners used to haul the ore to the surface. Now it is nothing more than a pile of rubble. No one bothered to clear it as they feared whatever might be found inside. Instead it fell into oblivion.
    Once used for storing the coal that fueled the Foundry, it now lies abandoned. The roof is split wide open, suggesting some titanic explosion, but the angles don’t seem to make sense. So to fathom its destiny is not done easily - even if one would want to.
    The woods surrounding the estate might be the only witness to what really happened here. Its trees have a certain deformed character, as if what they saw made them want to run away. There are very few visitors to the woods - even animals seem to avoid it if possible.
    The beating heart of the Mine, the Foundry was where the iron ore was directly smelted into vast ingots. The huge vats still bear evidence of the bodies that were incinerated within them - preserved in the metal residue.
    On the eastern edge of the estate, near the woods, lie the remains of the MacMillan warehouse. Dwarfing the surrounding buildings, the massive storehouse can often be heard creaking and groaning as if it were crying out with the anguish of the incinerated laborers.
    Groaning Storehouse
    While the Yamaoka estate displayed a glorious past, but the family residence was falling apart. The house needed numerous renovations to remain habitable.<br><br>The last generation of the Yamaoka family were facing troubled times. Their finances were dire and the situation worsened when the daughter started university, just a few months before the mother became ill. Shouldering both university fees and hospital bills, the father worked past exhaustion.<br><br>To keep a roof over their heads, he profaned their legacy. The walls of their ancestral home were sealed with moldy materials for a cheap fix.<br><br>As the house was stripped of its integrity, an old anger was awakened.
    Family Residence
    The Pale Rose
    The half-forgotten, temple complex dedicated to the cleansing of the High Priestess’s followers. The vertiginous hypostyle hall was believed to hold the weight of the heavens.<br>Stolen from the memories of The Plague, the temple was planted in the howling Red Forest, whose winds eroded its smooth edges. It now stands as a beacon of fear, visible from all cardinal points.
    The Temple of Purgation
    Deep in a forest with many names lies a hidden home. The family that once lived there was dependent on the forest… and was broken by it. More than a century old, the dwelling is in surprisingly good condition, though it shows signs of often being patched and mended. The forest holds the house tightly in its grasp, growing over and around it like a second skin. Only once inside is it clear that someone still lives there. It is warm and welcoming and lovingly decorated, with a large living space, a bedroom and a corner dedicated for little ones. Here they are protected from the harsh winter of the northern forest.
    Mother's Dwelling
    Badham Preschool III
    Badham Preschool II
    Badham Preschool IV
    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls.

    One shack stood apart from the rest of the village. Once the water was drained and the area beneath the base was revealed, the true horror of the swamp's cage was discovered. It was here that the prisoners, if that's what we should call them, were brought. Held in the water, their bodies bloating horrendously, they were plucked, one by one for the family's needs. The stilts that kept the building upright acted as the only bars that awful jail needed.

    Embrace the immense unknown and surrender yourself to the vast inexplicable: that is the oath of the faithful. When surrounded by darkness, they look inward for a beacon of light to follow, trusting it will lead them to safety. But when their light is distorted by pride and ambition, how long will they err in the dark?<br><br>Sold to a Babylonian temple as a child, she sought the means to repel the darkness she carried inside. She found solace in sacred rituals, where she felt safe and empowered. Faithful but proud, she began to rise in status and believed she was untouchable. But when a plague began to defile her body, she confronted her gods, realizing too late that they had no impact on her fate.<br><br>Jane Romero was striving to become a powerful icon, a voice that would inspire and support those in need. She fought against powerful executives to send out her message about owning up to your insecurities. Her goal was to release people from the painful experiences that plagued their chances at a successful future. Every day she would share her beliefs and practices with thousands of avid followers. Adding to her success was the growing pressure from the media to fit the mold, and a difficult past that weighted on her shoulders, which made her question her legitimacy. One evening, she was driving home after a particularly stressful live show, and feeling drained, she closed her eyes for a moment that had lasting consequences.

    During a weekend at a cabin with friends, Ash uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off.<br><br>For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of all those around him. After a terrible fight with a fully formed Kandarian demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.<br><br>After his deal with a demon went South, Ash found himself in the realm of the Entity, without shotgun or chainsaw.

    Of Flesh and Mud is the third Chapter for Dead by Daylight. Prepare for dark hexes and flesh made out of mud and decay, if you dare enter Backwater Swamp and live through the horror it brings. A new killer - The Hag - awaits you in the waterland area and you will meet a new survivor: Ace Visconti.<br><br>A hag driven to madness by being devoured alive piece by piece. A survivor that believes luck is always on his side. A wetland with scorched shacks, an eerie mud maze and a rusting boat graveyard lays ahead of you, so tread carefully.
    Acquaintances are a dangerous deception. Our workplace is filled with them; strangers beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise.<br><br>The Ghost Face took full advantage of the fact. His entourage at the newspaper could have spotted that the Roseville murders led to him. There were clues: the days he missed work, the victims’ time of death, and the detailed articles he wrote citing sources he never shared. But his coworkers did not see. Ghost Face blended into the everyday.  No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.<br><br>In the end, The Ghost Face would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. But this time he found a richer hunting ground…

    It was the early 1980s, a time of cold war experiments and naive fascination, a time of stranger things. In the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, covert experiments were being conducted.<br><br>When an inter-dimensional gate was accidentally opened at the Hawkins National Laboratory, an army of creatures with long, curved claws and gaping faces that bloom like horrific flowers was unleashed. These creatures were labeled “Demogorgons” by a group of local kids who encountered them.<br><br>Nancy Wheeler’s knack for investigative journalism first emerged when she brought down a secret government organization in Hawkins following the disappearance of her closest friend, Barb. Her being fired from the Hawkins Post during the summer of 1985 has not dissuaded Nancy from chasing leads...<br><br>Formerly a popular jock, Steve Harrington, is struggling to find his place in Hawkins now that high school is over, and his old friends moved away to college. Since then, he’s spent his time scooping ice cream at the mall, flirting with girls, and cracking secret Russian codes. With the help of his friends Dustin and Robin, Steve is carving out a new identity for himself and learning what true friendship really means. It’s this newfound loyalty to his friends that compels Steve to come to the aid of his ex-girlfriend, Nancy when he suspects she might be in terrible danger...

    Adam was born in Rollington Town in Kingston, Jamaica. His father died in a car accident when he was two, and his uncle took him in. His uncle was a strict, but fair man, who raised him to value education.<br><br>At Kingston College, Adam discovered his father’s published works, which triggered his passion for literature. His campus, however, was known for its focus on athletics. As a shy teenager with his nose stuck in books, he was the perfect prey for bullies. What he lacked in sports, he made up in grit. He learned to defend himself in the thick of it.<br><br>It’s during his years in college that he started to imagine his life elsewhere. While his close friends orbited the music industry, he followed a surer path. His grades granted him admission to higher education, and there was a demand for teachers abroad.<br><br>After graduating university, he taught extra classes to afford applying fees overseas. He had a steady diet of long commutes, grading piles, nightly lesson plans, and early classes. After a year, he managed to apply for a position abroad. His first plane ride took him to Southern Japan for a new start.<br><br>His life in Kagoshima was hectic. There was little time to do everything he took for granted back home. His Japanese was elementary at best, which slowed him down. Buying groceries took hours, long commutes had to be planned, and lesson plans relied on Japanese notions, which he had to learn.<br><br>But after a few months, he found his rhythm. He reflected on it one morning while riding the train to work. He no longer had to study the kanji characters filling the map. He knew his way. His language skills had improved, he felt connected to his students, and he’d treat himself to luxurious restaurants on weekends. He even had his first vacation planned.<br><br>Within seconds, Adam’s world was brought down to a slow motion. Rails hissed, bags came pouring down, and the floor trembled before the hit: Adam crashed forward as the train flipped upside down. He landed on a window pane as an unhinged door came flying at a passenger. He rolled over so that the door would hit him instead of the girl. He shut his eyes as he braced for impact, but nothing happened.<br><br>He squinted one eye open and he saw nothing but darkness. A heavy Fog had taken over the train. Ice seemed to flow through his body, reaching his lips first, then the tip of his fingers before spreading to his legs. Lulled by the warm hum of the dark whisper, he closed his eyes, drifting.<br><br>No one truly knows what happened to Adam Francis. The school teachers imagined the worst when they watched the train derailment on the news and saw he was missing. Their fears seemed to be confirmed when Adam’s bag was recovered from the crash site, but his body was never found. To this day, his uncle believes that Adam took off after the train crash, alive still, somewhere out there.
    A resourceful teacher, able to adapt to new circumstances and develop strategies accordingly. <br><br>His personal perks, <b>Diversion</b>, <b>Deliverance</b> and <b>Autodidact</b>, help him to distract The Killer, survive desperate situations, and become more skilled as the trial continues.
    During a weekend at a cabin with friends, Ashley J. Williams uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (the Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of those around him. But his coworkers, Pablo who was raised by a shaman and Kelly who was orphaned by the Deadites, helped him put up a fight. While battling Evil, Ash was reunited with his long-lost daughter Brandy, who encouraged him to embrace his role as savior of humanity. After a terrible fight with a fully formed demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.<br><br>Ash awakened to a voice, his head throbbing. Since defeating a gang of Deadites a week ago, he had been in a perpetual state of hangover. He heard the voice once more; a woman singing, sensual and inviting.<br><br>Stepping into the corridor in his boxers, he strode toward the voice, which lead to the public locker room. As Ash pushed open the door, the singing stopped. There was a rustling of curtains. He called out, entering the change room. His voice reverberated on the moldy tiled walls. He pressed on, reaching a shower that was still dripping wet. Cold, humid fingers ran down his bare back. He turned around.<br><br>A woman stood naked, her skin glistening in the morning light that streamed in from high windows. Ash recognized her instantly: Linda Emery, one of his former high school flings. They had gotten back together thirty years later, while saving their hometown from Evil. He had ended their relationship soon afterward, preferring to indulge freely in his new-found popularity.<br><br>Linda winked at Ash, who closed the distance between them. He caressed her cheek wistfully: <i>What was she doing here? Did she know anything about the whereabouts of her daughter? And Pablo and Kelly?</i><br><br>A sharp blade dug into his hand, making him jump back. Linda slid a finger across the edge of her blade, collecting Ash’s blood on her fingertip. She smiled, and her skin shriveled, her hair faded, her shoulders stooped, and her curves sagged, aging decades older in a matter of seconds. She attacked Ash, who poorly managed to block, being half-naked.<br><br>Every blow she delivered earned him a new wound. She slashed his bad knee and he fell to the floor. As she jumped on top of him, Ash shrieked in disgust, knocking the knife out of her grasp. Her varicose hands wrapped around his neck, strangling him. Gasping, he outstretched his arm, hand landing on a soap dispenser. He spurted out some liquid on his fingers and poked her in the eyes. The elderly woman winced, weakening her hold, and Ash elbowed her in the face, knocking her back. He rolled over and grabbed the knife on the floor. Just as he was about to plant it in her chest, he stopped. There was something else he wanted more.<br><br>He pressed the blade against her throat. <i>Let’s make a deal, demon. In exchange for not killing you, you portal me back to my friends.</i> The demon agreed.<br><br>She began reciting the incantation, instructing Ash to repeat after her, which he failed to manage. When nothing happened, Ash threatened the demon, who argued back, blaming his poor pronunciation. Their combined exchange of Sumerian words triggered a hiss from the showers behind them. The wet tiled floor darkened, and the pipes burst. A whirlpool of dirty water, shower curtains, and used toilet paper swallowed the demon, while Ash held onto a locker door, which slowly slipped from his fingers.<br><br><i>FFFUUUC—</i><br><br>Ash landed flat on his chest in the realm of the Entity, sputtering grass. He got up, brushing off the dry clothes he suddenly had on. Then he looked around and his grin fell. It was the kind of place that made two things obvious: one, there wasn’t any bar for miles, and two, he was going to need his shotgun and chainsaw, both of which he lacked. As he started to walk toward a glinting light ahead, a scream rippled through the trees.<br><br><i>Groovy.</i>

    Detective David Tapp was one of the good guys. His determination to see Killers brought to justice and their victims avenged had led him through a long and respected career.<br><br>When he first saw the details of the Jigsaw case, it seemed like many others. More grisly and macabre, sure, but just another lunatic with a penchant for the over-dramatic, who would soon be behind bars.<br><br>A stroke of insight brought Tapp, and his partner Detective Stephen Sing, to an abandoned mannequin factory, where they discovered Jigsaw’s lair. They apprehended the man but he managed to escape before being unmasked, slashing Tapp’s throat as he did so.<br><br>Leaving his partner, Sing went in pursuit, but fell victim to a booby trap.<br><br>Tapp had failed to go by the book on this one occasion, entering the lair without a warrant, and it had resulted in a Detective’s death. He was discharged from the force and left with a ruined throat and crippling guilt.<br><br>He channeled that guilt into an obsession: he would find the Killer, stop the murders, vindicate himself, and avenge his friend and colleague. Following the evidence trail brought him to Dr Lawrence Gordon and he staked out the doctor’s apartment, sure that he would find some evidence of guilt.<br><br>Then he saw a stranger at Gordon’s window, and heard gunshots. Tapp confronted him and the man fled, with the pursuit leading to an industrial building.<br><br>Tapp’s age caught up with him, A fight that he would easily have won in his younger days ended with Tapp taking a bullet to the chest. Slumping to the floor, he saw only failure. He had failed his partner, and the other victims. Whoever the Killer was, Tapp had been unable to stop him. More would die and it would be his fault.<br><br>He let the rage and guilt consume him and closed his eyes for the final time. Beneath him, the concrete floor softened. He dug his fingers into the ground, feeling dirt and leaves. Where his chest had been wet with blood, the shirt was now dry and the pain had gone. His eyes opened onto a darkened sky and the jagged, searching fingers of branches.<br><br>Screams echoed through the forest and a new determination filled him. His mind was clear for the first time in months. Victims needed to be avenged, Killers thwarted. He didn’t know what this place was, but he was still a cop, and he always would be. He had a job to do.

    One of Kate Denson’s earliest memories was standing in front of her family, singing a song that she’d learned that morning at school, and watching smiles spread across their faces. Seeing how something as simple as a song could make people so happy was the moment when she knew what she wanted to do with her life.<br><br>She practised, learned the guitar as soon as she was big enough to reach over it, and was performing in front of crowds by the time she was eight years old. Her mother did everything she could to fulfil Kate’s dreams, taking her all over home state of Pennsylvania, then across the South, and even to Nashville itself.<br><br>Kate won folk music competitions and talent shows whenever she participated, but for her to win others had to lose, and that wasn’t in her nature. She only wanted an outlet, a way to touch people’s lives. To make them forget the worries of the world and just enjoy themselves, if only for a while.<br><br>With age came a new-found freedom. She bought a battered old Chevy truck and was able to travel around by herself, meeting fans and making new friends wherever she stopped. Hers wasn’t a story of rock excess though: just the road, her guitar and maybe a good bourbon to end the day.<br><br>From sun-baked festivals to dark and cosy bars, people flocked to her voice and her self-penned songs of friendship, family, love and home.<br><br>These sentiments weren’t just lip-service: she made sure to return home as often as she could, to help out in her community and entertain the local children with her tales of the wider world. She saw it as a way of giving back, of supporting others in the same way she had.<br><br>It was home where she found most of her inspiration as well. She had always loved to take long walks in the woods around her town, exploring off the beaten track, finding a quiet spot to play and write her songs. She had a favorite location she returned to time and again, a natural hollow, encircled by trees, that looked almost as if it had been blasted out of the rocks thousands of years ago.<br><br>Here she felt a strong connection to nature, and to the Earth itself. She let her mind be enveloped by the forest and it rewarded her with constant inspiration.<br><br>She picked up her guitar and played, her fingers dancing across the fretboard. The music that she made this time was unlike her usual uplifting tunes, being much more melancholy, even dark. Still, something compelled her to continue, to finish the song.<br><br>Around her, the leaves vibrated in unison with the guitar strings and the boughs of the trees lengthened, coalescing into a living form. Spider-like legs descended from the canopy above, grasping for her. Regaining her senses, she grabbed a rock and tried to beat them back, but their skin was as hard as iron and the rock simply bounced off and skittered away.<br><br>The legs coiled like tendrils around her limbs and lifted her towards the darkness overhead. Fog rolled across the clearing, obscuring both Kate and the creature of nightmares that drew her up towards itself.<br><br>When the fog cleared, there was no sign of any struggle, or of life. Just an acoustic guitar, the scratch plate engraved with flowers; as well as the initials KD, inlaid in mother of pearl.

    Jeff Johansen was born and raised in Ormond, Alberta. He grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion for large crowds. During high school, his anxious nature was mislabelled as shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated bullies and teachers alike. At home, he discovered an interest for heavy metal and started a vinyl collection. The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make some art of his own, which helped him cope with his parents’ constant fighting.<br><br>To escape his parents’ increasingly recurrent blow-ups, Jeff started working at a video store. Few customers passed by, so he had a lot of free time to draw. A late-night regular noticed his sketches and asked him to do some artwork for his gang at the abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Jeff accepted the challenge and painted a large mural depicting “The Legion” in runny, bloody letters. He was given a fifty-dollar bill and a 12-pack for his hard work. It was his first paid commission, a milestone to be proud of.<br><br>After his parents’ divorce, Jeff was forced to move with his mother to Winkler, Manitoba, which was miles away from his hometown—and his dad. In Winkler, Jeff was more isolated than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly after graduating high school when he started working at a local bar with live music performances. He found a roadie gig shortly after, leaving Winkler behind.<br><br>A few years later, Jeff got injured after getting involved in a fight during a concert. He was told he could lose part of his eyesight, so his doctor asked him to stay in town in order to monitor him. It was a difficult time during which Jeff re-assessed his life choices.<br><br>He went back to school—art school. His eyesight slowly returned, but he had to be careful. He took a few courses, experimenting with a wide range of mediums, ultimately choosing oil painting and digital art, the later of which offered paid internships. He took up a desk job and found his calling in designing labels for microbreweries. He led a quiet, simple life: he brewed beer, took-in a rescue dog, designed tattoos, and freelanced album covers for bands he liked. All until one morning, when he got a phone call from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few things to sort out.<br><br>Jeff drove all the way back to Ormond. He felt a pang of nostalgia when he reached his late father’s house. Inside, there was an old guitar case sitting in against the wall. It held a black, vintage model with a sticky note that said, “for my boy.”<br><br>He stayed in town longer than he planned to, reminiscing about his childhood. Driving by his former high school, he remembered the mural he painted up Mount Ormond. He bought a 12-pack and headed to the lodge.<br><br>After weeks of not hearing back from Jeff, his colleagues assumed that grief had gotten the better of him. His neighbor got tired of sitting his dog, which became more and more agitated as days went by. The dog became a stray again, erring while seeking the familiar trail of Jeff’s malty scent.
    A quiet artist, standing steadfast against impossible odds.<br><br>His personal perks, <b>Breakdown</b>, <b>Aftercare</b> and <b>Distortion</b>, give him observational advantages and help to hide his presence from The Killer.
    Jane Romero was the daughter of famous actress, Loretta Lawrence, of whom she had no memory. Her parents had separated when she was still a baby, mainly since her mother was often away filming. Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual artist. She grew up torn between resenting her mother’s absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.<br><br>As a teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother’s talent. She would direct and perform in plays, audition for TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio-station that contacted her for an interview. During the live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.<br><br>After graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to work for a trendy variety show. But her frank delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show’s executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio-station she used to work at, only to be turned down, her proposal being <i>too risky</i>.<br><br>Four months later, she received a phone call from a producer who had seen reruns of the show. He was looking for a co-host to spark up the failing show, <i>Quick Talk</i>.<br><br>Live television meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability, but it also offered a platform to broadcast her views. She disputed the crude inflammatory tone of <i>Quick Talk</i> and pushed for a relatable coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated with her audience and within weeks, the show’s viewership was steadily growing.<br><br>After two years, she launched a full-hour segment called <i>The Jane Romero Show</i>, which was broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal struggle with abandonment. Her show broke records and her initials J.R. became synonymous with products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.<br><br>But Jane needed more; she wanted others to follow in her footsteps. She published a memoir that covered her childhood with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it <i>a serving of sad anecdotes seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips</i>. Jane took this criticism to heart, since despite her success, a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her achievements.<br>Her success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a particularly tense week, she canned an episode and instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her stress peaked when she learned that her mother had agreed to star in her show.<br><br>Jane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went without a hitch, but when her mother walked on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane’s stomach lurched unpleasantly. She was consumed by a violent envy that had been festering. Yet she carried on with a strained smile, until Loretta interrupted her, saying that they were not actually related. The interview went haywire after that.<br><br>After the show, Jane was driving to her father’s house in New Jersey. She needed to talk things over with him; she had not been feeling like herself lately. She turned on a freeway along the coast to avoid major congestion and popped some pain killers to numb the throbbing pain in her temples, which had been nagging her all day. Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; classical music was playing. The drive was slow. Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on their way back home. Night fell. A darkness began to blur the corners of her vision and turned the headlights into swirls of red. Jane blinked to sharpen their outlines, but each time she closed her eyes, her eyelids became heavier and slower, until they remained shut, for a moment too long.<br><br>The following morning, authorities were fishing out Jane’s car from the water. Despite leading a meticulous search for weeks, they were unable to retrieve her body.<br><br>The airing and production of <i>The Jane Romero Show</i> was suspended until after her funeral, which her father and mother attended.<br><br>As the public grieved for Jane, there was a surge of orders for J.R. products and all her episodes were re-released a month later, with an opening credit that wished her eternal peace.

He even helped him find his slimy inter-dimensional pet Demogorgon, D’Artagnan.  His reputation as a protector grew and he soon became a sort of ‘babysitter’ for a group of kids in Hawkins with a knack for messing around with strange and dangerous things. His courage is unmatched so that he was even able to fend off a Demogorgon when it threatened his friends. One evening he received a call for assistance from his friend Nancy Wheeler. He drove all the way to the Hawkins National Laboratory to see if she was okay. He searched the area but only found her notebook. Before he realized what was happening the ground opened up and a swirl of black mist filled his eyes. When he awakened he was in a strange place that seemed familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.

    When he heard that Nancy’s mother had disappeared, Quentin Smith knew instantly that their success had been short-lived. Although their plan had seemed to work flawlessly, Freddy Krueger had beaten death yet again.<br>But Quentin wasn’t about to give up. It might take many attempts, but he vowed that somehow he would find a way to beat Freddy, once and for all. If he didn’t, it would only be a matter of time before Freddy would win and Nancy was lost.<br>Someone like Quentin never attracted attention in a library, no matter how strange the texts he requested were. He devoured all the information he could, on shared dream worlds, lucid dreaming, and the methods to control the dream space. Forcing himself to stay awake, via a steady diet of pills and energy drinks, he searched through dusty volumes, finding myths about the demons that live in dreams, trapping their victims in limbo and feeding off their terror. <br>He worked quickly as he knew that Freddy would soon be coming for him.<br>It wasn’t long before that moment arrived and Freddy began appearing in his dreams. He stayed at the periphery at first, taunting Quentin, seemingly hoping to tire him out. Using all that he had learned, Quentin was able to see flaws in the dream; cracks where escape routes could be formed. He tested this skill carefully, not wanting to show his hand, hoping that it would give him some kind of advantage that he could use to defeat Freddy. <br>Then, one night, he found himself in the familiar environment of Badham Preschool. Freddy had tired of the taunting and had finally decided to gut him.<br>Quentin ran through the school, his quick eyes scanning for something useful in the maze of rooms. He found a can of paint thinner and quickly formulated a plan. <br>Once the trap was set, he waited, acting as the lure to draw Freddy into the right position. And there he was, claws scraping on metal as he closed in for the kill. <br>Quentin allowed himself time to enjoy the surprise on Freddy’s face as the corridor ignited and then he was away, running through the building, heading for the exit that he knew existed. If he harried Freddy, weakening him and then escaping the dream to safety, surely that would defeat him over time?<br>Before his eyes, the cracks in the dream closed and his escape route was blocked. He was in Freddy’s secret room again, and there was nowhere to run.<br>As Freddy closed in, a broad grin spreading across his ruined face, Quentin was consumed by a need to see this man finally obliterated. He wished it had been him, not his father, who threw the gas can that ended Krueger’s life, that it had been him who cut Freddy’s throat. Perhaps that desire would be enough? This was a realm of the mind after all. <br>He let it consume him, concentrating all his thoughts on wishing Freddy gone.<br>His vision was obscured with roiling tendrils of fog and, when it cleared, he was somewhere else. In another dream? If so, it wasn’t his; it felt cold and unfamiliar.<br>A flickering drew his attention and he realised he was by a campfire, and he wasn’t alone. Other people were trapped here too, and they needed his help.

    There are boogey men, and they do live under your bed. They are inside your room, and inside your mind - your dreams and sometimes dreams come true. Freddy Krueger knows the true meaning of haunting. The true meaning of pushing someone into that dream state where you are uncertain whether you are awake or asleep - alive or on the verge of death. Some more than others will resist sleep, like young Quentin, who is forced to head back where Freddy learned about revenge. Back to Badham Preschool.

    The Survivors' main objective is to complete repairs on generators, open an Exit Gate and escape. As a Killer, you can slow Survivor progress by kicking partially repaired generators. This action slowly but continuously regresses the progress that Survivors have made in repairing the generator.
    Notice the objective information in the bottom-left of the screen. With the final generator complete, the switch is powered and the Exit Gate can be opened. In most matches, there will be a total of 5 generators to complete.
    Notice the objective information in the bottom-left of the screen. With the final generator complete, the switch is powered and the Exit Gate can be opened. In most matches, there will be a total of 5 generators to complete. Stop the Survivors before they can escape!
    Additionally, a Hatch has appeared somewhere in the environment. The Hatch will only open by itself when only one Survivor remains in the trial.
    Though the Survivor is no longer in immediate danger, they are injured and require attention. Survivors may heal each other without the use of special items, however, first-aid kits can help speed up the process.
    In an injured state, Survivors make more noise and leave patches of blood that the Killer can follow to uncover your location. While injured, you are also much more vulnerable to the Killer's attacks - one more hit will put you into 'dying' state.
    Certain Survivor actions (vaulting through windows, repairing generators, using the Exit Gate switch) may be interrupted by the killer, while other situations may allow the Killer to pick them up directly (from Bear traps, or out of lockers). Tap the attack button while directly next to a Survivor performing an interaction to interrupt. Take advantage of these opportunities!
    Every Killer has their own individual powers to learn and master. Each Killer has a different way to track and kill their prey. Try them all and experiment with different combinations of perks and add-ons.
    "I attempted this escape many a time, much to my own folly. It was a fool's quest that resulted in more pain than it was often worth."
    "I have stood at these gates many times before with the same sobering thought: what will await me on the other side?"
    "These tools, but poor replicas, shall suffice. I have taken every advantage I could take to survive in this forsaken nightmare."
    "In my explorations, I found that these strange machines were the key to my survival. The more light they produced, the closer I became to my freedom."
    "On one rare occasion, I encountered an alternative way to escape. It suddenly dawned on me that I was the only remaining Survivor."
    "I shall not despair for my life is not yet forfeit!"
    "Again, my senses have proven to be the keys to my survival. If my heartbeat rings in my ears, the Killer is close. If I see the 'red stain' in my surroundings, the Killer is even closer!"
    "The Entity worked to keep me on my toes, or at least, keep me distracted. Either way, I was given the opportunity to avoid disaster. Indeed, if my timing was precise, I found that my actions were much more effective!"
    "I can't be caught if I can't be found."
    "It seemed to me that repairing these generators was the only way to power this switch box. What would happen if I were to activate it?"
    Sacrifice
    Certain actions may occasionally produce a "Skill Check". Escaping a trial alive will require a combination of teamwork and competence. Failing to time Skill Checks consistently may make survival more challenging.
    Killers may injure or down Survivors with a well-timed blow from their primary weapon. Try not to miss as it may give them the brief moment they need to escape from your grasp.
    Killers may injure or down Survivors with a well-timed blow from their primary weapon. Try not to miss as it may give them the brief moment they need to escape from your grasp.
    When a Survivor has been stuck on the hook for an extended period of time, The Entity is summoned forth, forcing them to struggle for their life. Hooking a Survivor twice will force them in to struggle state immediately, or sacrifice them if they have already been in struggle state.
    Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric game that is played in trials between up to four Survivors and one murderous Killer. As a Killer, your main objective is to attack, down, and hook as many Survivors as possible.
    Your survival in the trial may be hindered by a murderous Killer whose only goal is to sacrifice as many Survivors as possible. Use every resource available to avoid being in the presence of the Killer. Listen out for the 'Terror Radius' - or heartbeat - it may help you recognize when the Killer is nearby.
    Killers have several means of tracking and locating Survivors. Look out for the scratch marks that Survivors leave when they run. Injured and dying Survivors also produce noises of pain and anguish, and leave a trail of blood that may lead you directly to their location.
    "The meat. It bleeds."
    "Catch meat. Sacrifice meat. Appease The Entity."
    "Do not let the light in!" 
    "The Entity is pleased! Kill more meat!"

    "Wiggle, little worm. Wiggle."

    While in treatment mode, The Doctor's regular attack is replaced with a shock therapy area attack which greatly increases the madness level of any Survivors it hits.
    At madness level II, Survivors experience shared hallucinations that The Doctor can also see. At madness level III, The Doctor can read these hallucinations' auras from a distance.
    When reaching new levels of madness, Survivors scream and reveal their location to all players.
    At madness level III, Survivors cannot repair, heal, sabotage or cleanse. They will also scream periodically, revealing their location. They must stay still and "snap out of it" to return to madness level II.
    The Hillbilly is equipped with a Chainsaw that can smash pallets and put Survivors in the dying state in one hit. While using his Chainsaw he moves at incredible speed, but is briefly stunned if he collides with objects or walls.
    Facing the Hillbilly
    The Cannibal wields his Chainsaw with deadly precision. He can turn easily to hit Survivors all around, which put them in the dying state. The Cannibal suffers a long stun when he collides with objects - but be careful! His Chainsaw is still lethal during this stun.
    Facing The Cannibal
    The Doctor inflicts madness on his victims using his static field and shock therapy attack. There are 3 tiers of madness with various afflictions. Reaching a madness tier causes Survivors to scream, which reveals their position to all players.
    Facing The Doctor
    Walking too close to The Hag’s trap causes a frightening phantasm to appear. The Hag can teleport directly to a triggered trap as long as she is within range. Survivors can avoid triggering her traps by crouching through the trap zone, or burning the traps with a flashlight.
    Facing The Hag
    The Huntress can hit Survivors from a distance when throwing her Hatchets. Listen out for her humming to spot her before she spots you!
    Facing the Huntress
    The Nurse can blink through walls and other solid objects. After blinking, she has a short window in which to attack or blink again before she is affected by fatigue, which reduces her speed and impairs her vision. Try anticipate where she will blink, break line of sight, and escape while she is fatigued.
    Facing The Nurse
    The Shape’s power changes as he stalks Survivors. In tier I, he’s slower and has a short lunge range but can easily sneak up on Survivors with a much smaller Terror Radius.
    Facing The Shape
    The Trapper can set traps almost anywhere. Windows, pallets, choke points and tall grass are all commonly trapped areas. These traps injure and immobilize their victims. Survivors can attempt to escape on their own (25% chance per attempt) or they can be saved by another Survivor.
    Facing The Trapper
    Actively look for a shimmer, as The Wraith’s cloak makes him near invisible. While cloaked he moves faster, has no Terror Radius can interact with objects but cannot attack. A 'whoosh' sound indicates that he has used his power, hearing the bell ring means that The Wraith is close.
    Facing The Wraith
    The Hag is smaller than other Killers, making her more difficult to be spotted from afar. She excels at using line of sight blockers to hide her approach.

    The Hag can teleport to any activated phantasm trap for the duration that it is active if she is within teleportation range. Phantasm traps will be highlighted in white when The Hag is in range to teleport and in red when she is not.
    Survivors can avoid triggering phantasm traps by crouching past them. Try placing traps in places Survivors wouldn't expect!
    The Hag can place to 10 phantasm traps in the level at once. Triggered phantasm traps can disorient Survivors and allow The Hag to teleport to them.
    If multiple phantasm traps are activated, The Hag can prioritize which trap she will teleport to by looking in its direction.
    A distinctive audio cue can be heard once the Hatchet has been wound up to its maximum strength.

    The Huntress
    The Huntress
    When out of Hatchets, search in any nearby lockers, indicated by a yellow aura. Every locker refills your Hatchets to maximum.
    When charging the Hatchet throw, the Huntress movement speed is slightly slower. A fully charged Hatchet throw is slightly faster.
    If you lose a Survivor, listen closely! You may hear their footsteps. If they are injured, you'll be able to track them by listening to their groans of pain.
    Running Survivors leave red scratch marks in the environment that only Killers can see. Use them to track Survivor movements.
    Killer add-ons can modify their power in many ways. They are consumed once the trial ends.
    Hooking Survivors on The Entity's sacrificial hook is the Killer's primary goal and is therefore one of the actions that awards the most bloodpoints.
    Though they share most basic abilities, every Killer has a unique power.
    Generators undergoing repairs make a lot of noise. This can tip the Killer off to the Survivors' location, or it can be used by Survivors to mask other noisy actions such as healing.
    Loud noise events, such as when a Survivor misses a Skill Check, alert the Killer to the Survivor's location.
    The Killer sees the aura (outline) of all unrepaired generators. Patrolling generators is a great way to find Survivors.
    Killers can break dropped pallets. This action takes some time, but renders the pallet completely unusable.
    A healthy Survivor hit by the Killer will enter the injured state. Another successful hit will put the Survivor into the dying state. A dying Survivor can be picked up by the Killer and brought to a sacrificial hook.
    During a chase, the Killer must pay attention to the environment and the Survivor's movements to guess their next move.
    Survivors can aim their flashlights directly at the Killer's eyes to blind them briefly and make them drop any Survivors they were carrying. The time required to blind a Killer depends on the flashlight and add-ons used.
    Survivors can escape a Killers grasp by "wiggling free", which takes some time. Killers must make haste to a hook before Survivors wiggle free. A successful wiggle free will stun the Killer for a few seconds.
    Survivors can drop pallets on the Killer to stun them temporarily.
    Crows can be found in every level. These servants of The Entity will take off and caw when disturbed. Killers can use the crows to pinpoint the location of moving Survivors.
    Hold down the attack interaction to perform a lunge attack. This attack grants a burst of speed, but the Killer is slowed while they recover.
    Once The Entity has consumed a Survivor on a sacrificial hook, that hook is destroyed and can no longer be used. This does not apply to basement hooks, which cannot be destroyed.
    Injured Survivors leave trails of blood. Follow the blood trail to catch them before they can heal.
    Experienced Survivors tend to run with a plan. When chasing, try to identify windows, pallets and line of sight blockers in the area to predict Survivors' movements.
    Many Survivor actions can be interrupted, giving the Killer a free grab and pick up. To initiate an interrupt, activate the attack interaction at close range while the Survivor is occupied. Lunge attacks do not trigger interrupts.
    Hitting a healthy Survivor grants them a short burst of speed.

    At Evil Within tier I, The Shape has a very small Terror Radius which allows him to lurk near his victims without alerting them to his presence.
    The Shape
    The Shape
    The Shape
    The Shape
    The Shape
    The Shape must keep Survivors in his line of sight while stalking in order to build up his power.
    When The Shape's Evil Within reaches tier III, he changes stance. For a limited time, his window vault speed and lunge range are increased and his attacks automatically put Survivors in the dying state.
    The Shape increases the power of his Evil Within by stalking Survivors.
    There is a limit to how much power The Shape can gain from stalking a Survivor. If a stalked Survivor's highlight is bright red, no more power can be gained from stalking that Survivor.
    After blinking, The Nurse has a short window to either attack or blink again (if she has blinks remaining) before becoming fatigued. Attacking after blinking increases fatigue time.
    The Nurse
    The Nurse
    The Nurse
    The Nurse
    The Nurse
    The Nurse
    The Nurse gets fatigued for a few seconds after a blink. During this time, The Nurse cannot attack or interact and has limited vision.
    The Nurse can travel long distances quickly, through walls and objects, using her blink ability.
    The longer The Nurse charges her blink, the further the distance she can travel.
    The Nurse's blink power comes at a cost. Her base movement speed is slower than most Killers.
    When The Nurse is holding a fully charged blink, she clenches her fist.
    Survivors should be mindful of their actions. Running leaves tracks only the Killer can see. Loud, rushed actions like fast window vaults or quick locker entry trigger visual notifications for the Killer as well.
    When injured, a Survivor can be healed by another Survivor, or they can heal themselves with a med-kit.
    When injured, a Survivor is easier to locate. An injured Survivor is more noisy and leaves behind a trail of blood.
    Survivors are awarded bloodpoints for completing objectives, evading the Killer, surviving the trial, and helping other Survivors.
    A Survivor in the dying state cannot fully recover to the injured state on their own without the help of a perk or another Survivor to help them.
    Skillful interactions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging will periodically trigger Skill Checks. There is an audio notification before a Skill Check appears.
    Generators can often be located by searching for the flashing lights above them.
    Failing a Skill Check sets back an action's progress and notifies the Killer of the Survivor's location.
    If a Survivor does not survive the trial, they lose any items and add-ons that they were carrying.
    Survivors can attempt to evade Killers by hiding in lockers. Killers can search lockers, but spend precious time doing so.
    A hooked Survivor can be rescued by other Survivors. In the first phase of the sacrifice, they may also attempt to unhook themselves (with a 4% base chance of succeeding) at the cost of accelerating the sacrifice progress.
    The number beside the generator icon indicates how many more generators the Survivors must repair before the Exit Gates can be opened.
    The Terror Radius, also known as the heartbeat, indicates the Killer's approach. The more intense it gets, the closer the Killer is!
    Survivors vault more quickly through a window when running, but they are much louder and notify the Killer of their location.
    Dropping a pallet creates a loud noise that gives away your position to the Killer. It can also be used as a diversion.
    Offerings are consumed once the match starts, unless they conflict with other offerings.
    While in a trial, Survivors can swap their carried item for other items found in a chest or on the ground.
    Dull totems can always be found scattered throughout the trial area. Certain Killer perks (called Hex perks) activate dull totems and turn them into Hex Totems. Cleansing a Hex Totem deactivates its associated Hex perk. All totems grant bloodpoints when they are cleansed.
    Successfully escaping the Killer during a chase awards Survivors with bloodpoints.
    Once enough generators have been repaired, the Survivors' goal is to activate one of the two exit switches which will open the Exit Gate for Survivors to escape through.
    Actions such as repairing generators or healing injured allies are performed much faster when cooperating with other Survivors.
    A Survivor who is hooked for the third time (or the second time if they reached the second phase of the sacrifice) will automatically summon The Entity to complete the sacrifice sequence.
    If you are the last Survivor left alive, the Hatch may be available as an alternate escape! Look for the Hatch icon beside the number of generators that need to be completed. If the icon is present then the Hatch is open. Find the Hatch and make a swift exit.
    Carried Survivors can attempt to wiggle free from the Killer's grasp. If a Survivor succeeds before the Killer hooks them, the Killer is momentarily stunned so that the Survivor can make a quick escape.
    Pay attention to the Killer's red stain. It tells you in which direction they are looking.
    Survivors can scavenge items from chests which may increase their odds of survival.
    The Entity will temporarily block a window if a Survivor vaults through it repeatedly in a short time. The window is only blocked for the Survivor that abused it.
    Dropping a pallet on a Killer momentarily stuns them.
    Survivors in the dying state can still escape by crawling to the Exit Gates or the Hatch.
    Pay attention to the other Survivors' status icons. They will let you know if Survivors are injured, dying or hooked.
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    When Survivors disarm a bear trap, it triggers a loud noise notification at the trap's location that can be seen by the Killer.
    The Trapper
    The Trapper

    The Trapper
    Windows, pallets and narrow paths are great strategic locations to place bear traps.
    The Trapper is notified when a Survivor steps in one of his bear traps. Once a Survivor is trapped it's a race to grab the Survivor before they can struggle free or be saved by a teammate.
    A careless Trapper can step into his own bear trap, causing him to drop any Survivor he was carrying.
    A Survivor with a toolbox or the Saboteur perk can sabotage bear traps and make them unusable.
    A cloaked Wraith is fully invisible while still, but causes a slight distortion while moving. He can also be detected by listening for his snarl or by certain detection perks.
    The Wraith
    The Wraith

    The Wraith
    The Wraith's movement speed is reduced while cloaking or uncloaking.
    The Wraith is vulnerable to flashlights while cloaked. Aiming the beam at The Wraith's body will burn him out of invisibility. He finds this very unpleasant.
    While cloaked, The Wraith is faster and has no Terror Radius. He can interact with lockers,pallets and generators, but he cannot attack.
    The Wraith must ring his bell in order to cloak or uncloak. Survivors hear The Wraith successfully cloaking from 40 meters, and the Survivors within 24 meters hear the ringing of the bell.

    It is impossible to describe the horrifying scenes I have witnessed… death and misery, in every shape of terror, rule this place.<br><br>I can no longer recall how I have come to this place. All I remember is the opaque, milky fumes of opium in the murky den hazing a sweet, welcoming abyss.<br><br>I awoke to dreadful screams in this endless night, at the feet an old tree that leaked foul-smelling fluids. I know not how to reach those poor souls, nor do I want to. Keeping a record is all I can do to make sense of it.
    Oct. 19th
    <b>1 - The Night</b>
    I discovered a hidden laboratory while running away from a monster. Its stocks are uncommonly plentiful. I observed shelves of alkaloids, crates of silver syringes, piles of protective clothes and a journal signed “Vigo.” Its pages are filled with notes on an ancient force that controls the nature of this place—that shapes it. I also noted a few drawings of the growing cankers I’ve seen on trees.
    Oct. 20th
    <b>2 - Vigo</b>
    I have been obsessively deciphering Vigo’s journal. His work is elegant but erratic, drawing obscure conclusions from disjointed fields.<br><br>Most entries mention a powerful force, The Entity, which undergoes a purge that occurs once a year. During this period, The Entity is infested with blight. According to Vigo, cankers bloom into “Pustulas,” a type of flower that spurts putrid nectar—the thick fluid I saw oozing from the trees. The last pages of the journal mention a serum distilled from the nectar, but the pages detailing its effects and preparation were torn out.
    Oct. 21st
    <b>3 - The Blight</b>
    I’m hiding in a dense strip of forest. I’m desperate to erase the distressful images engraved in my mind. Last night, a disfigured man barged into the laboratory with a gruesome, mechanical mouth and shred the walls into splinters. I barely escaped with my life—and wounded my arm in the process.<br><br>I have no options left; these monsters find me no matter where I go. All I have is a journal filled with obscure promises of escape.<br><br>I will return to the laboratory.
    Oct. 22nd
    <b>4 - Wounded</b>
    I’m close to death, I can feel it.<br><br>When I returned to the laboratory, I started experimenting with the putrid nectar and distilled it into a foul serum. But I made a terrible mistake. I injected the serum into a dead rodent, whose pupils dilated, and its body shook. I tried to restrain it, but the creature bit into my arm, ripping my wound open.<br><br>I stopped the bleeding, but I fear the damage is done.
    Oct. 23rd
    <b>5 - Experiment</b>
    I awoke to a terrible cry booming from the cellar and a violent bout of nausea. Through the vile ordeal, I started to recollect what had happened.<br><br>Tainted with the foul serum, my wound had swollen with lymph, at which point my assailant returned. Most of our fight was a blur, but I can recall red tears trickling down his gruesome cheeks as I clawed at his face. And some moment later when I kicked him, sending him crashing into a brick wall. The power I felt then… there are no words for it. I now know that there is truth to Vigo’s methods.<br><br>Another cry. My assailant, now chained in the cellar, must be getting restless.<br><br>This is just the beginning.
    Oct. 24th
    <b>6 - Experiment II</b>
    I should have foreseen his escape, given the potent dosage I administered him, but I needed to see results.<br><br>Pustula flowers are now blooming on the path leading to the laboratory. According to Vigo’s journal, this rapid spread is a sign that the blight is at its peak.<br><br>Soon, there will be no more putrid nectar to extract.
    Oct. 25th
    <b>7 - The Peak</b>
    I slept very little. The acute throbbing in my wound sent me on a restless, agitated drowse. I have no strength left to be patient, and my distress fosters brutal methods.<br><br>There are no lines I will not cross.
    Oct. 26th
    <b>8 - Exhausted</b>
    I limited my rest to only a few minutes here and there--I cannot afford wasting time. Pustulas, once lush with nectar, were withering away at the roots of cankerous trees. I could only extract droplets from a few frail flowers.<br><br>I’m running out of time.
    Oct. 27th
    <b>9 - Restless</b>
    Based on Vigo’s calculations, tonight is my last chance.<br><br>I filled a syringe with the last drops of serum and injected it into my arm.
    Oct. 28th
    <b>10 - At Last</b>
    I did everything right… and failed.<br><br>I am stuck in this infernal place with no serum and nowhere to hide.

    <b>11 - The End</b>
    I looked for Vigo. I shouted his name with no concern for the monsters lurking about. I need to find him… I picture the scene, etching a canvas of wild lines in my mind, focusing on the moon and I know--something is off.<br><br>I fed the dead rodent under my pillow.

    <b>12 - Vigo</b>
    Soon, very soon, I will be at peace.<br><br>The cold claws of death are drawing near.

    <i>NOTE: The Twitch Challenge feature is currently in Beta as we gather feedback from our community.</i>

<b>What are Twitch Challenges?</b>

Twitch Challenges are leaderboard competitions hosted by Twitch broadcasters for players to compete against each other based on Emblem scores at the end of a match. Certain Challenges may have associated prizes organized by the broadcaster.

<b>Who can create a Twitch Challenge?</b>

We are initially restricting the list of Challenge creators to our Fog Whisperers, with an eventual rollout to more broadcasters.

<b>Where can I see the leaderboard and my ranking?</b>

You can view the leaderboard and rankings on the broadcaster’s Twitch channel in the GameOn extension.

<b>What are Attempts?</b>

Attempts are the limited number of times you may contribute your Emblem score to a Challenge. Example: An Attempt limit of 3 means your next 3 matches will count towards the Challenge in which you’re currently participating.

<b>Why do I need a password for some Challenges?</b>

Some broadcasters may want to limit their created Challenge to a select group, such as their viewers or subscribers. In this case, this group will be able to retrieve the password on the broadcaster’s Twitch channel.

<b>What is the difference between "joining" and "participating"?</b>

Players may "join" a limit of 10 Challenges at any given time, but must select which Challenge they are "participating" towards for their next match. Any points earned at the end of a match and attempts used will be put towards this participating Challenge, with the ability to switch between joined Challenges between matches if the player wishes.
When a player submits their score for their last attempt, they will automatically start participating in the next available joined Challenge.

<b>Will I be matched with other members of a Twitch Challenge?</b>

Participation in a Twitch Challenge is passive, meaning matchmaking will continue as normal while your points are calculated on the side. You will continue to be matched with players who may or may not be participating in Twitch Challenges.
