    Manage an undo transaction. An undo transaction is defined as all actions which take place when the user selects "undo" a single time.

Your transaction logic should link to the Pending pin, and when done should link back to Finalize or Cancel, at which point the Complete pin will run.

Note: You must call TransactObject before modifying each object that should be included in the undo transaction.

    This only converts animation data -i.e. animation assets and Anim Blueprints. 
If you'd like to convert SkeletalMesh, use the context menu (Assign Skeleton) for each mesh. 

If you'd like to convert mesh as well, please do so before converting animation data. 
Otherwise you will lose any extra track that is in the new mesh.

    With the <RichText.TextHighlight>Widget Decorator</> you can <RichText.TextHighlight>inline any widget</> in your text!
    '{0}' is not a number
    '{0}' is not three characters
    <RichText.Header>What does it do?</>

The SRichTextBlock uses a concept called Decorators to introduce new font styles, images, animation and even whole interactive widgets inline with the text.

Slate comes with a couple Decorators out of the box:

        •  <RichText.Text.Fancy>Text</> Decorator
        •  <img src="RichText.ImageDecorator"/> Image Decorator
        •  <RichText.WidgetDecorator>Widget</> Decorator
        •  <a id="HyperlinkDecorator" style="RichText.Hyperlink">Hyperlink</> Decorator

<RichText.Header>What about options?</>

Of course you can always introduce your own Decorators by implementing ITextDecorator. This will give you full customization in how your text or widget is styled. 

Besides the power of Decorators the SRichTextBlock comes equipped with Margin support, Left-Center-Right Text Justification, a Line Height Scalar and Highlighting.

<RichText.Header>How does the markup work?</>

Well the markup parser is customizable so you can adjust the markup anyway you'd like by providing your own parser.  The parser that comes with Slate though uses a syntax very similar to xml.

        •  &lt;TextBlockStyleName>Your text content&lt;/>
        •  &lt;img src="SlateBrushStyleName"/>
        •  &lt;a id="YourCustomId"/>Your hyperlink text&lt;/>

If you ever want to use the markup syntax as actual text you can escape the markup using xml style escapes. For example:

        •  <    &amp;lt;
        •  >    &amp;gt;
        •  "     &amp;quot;

But you only need to escape these characters when a set of them match actual syntax so this isn't generally an issue.

<RichText.Header>Are there any catches?</>

There are still plenty of things the SRichTextBlock doesn't currently support. The most notable lacking feature is not having the ability to flow text around images or widgets. 
    <RichText.TextHighlight>SMultiLineEditableText</> utilizes the power of text marshallers to control how the source text is displayed, and the two editors below are demonstrating the <RichText.TextHighlight>FRichTextLayoutMarshaller</> and <RichText.TextHighlight>FRichTextSyntaxHighlighterTextLayoutMarshaller</> implementations.

You can use the toolbar to control the style of the text in the rich-text editor, or you can directly edit the source text (demonstrating live injection of style information) to update the rich-text view.

    Generic Text Item
    He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

    Here is an editable text box with a very long initial string.  Useful to test scrolling.
